Our visit was already on the upswing with the welcoming and friendly staff. To start, we ordered the warm mushroom salad, black truffle croquettes, cornbread madeleines, hamachi sashimi, marinated cucumbers, Maine lobster dumplings, Japanese...caesar salad, and the homemade burrata cheese. Wow, that seems a lot for 4 people lol, but everything was delicious and more importantly, shareable. I am still in awe how they crisp up parts of  the maitake mushrooms, and how luscious it feels in my mouth with the goat cheese and that vinaigrette, tho! It is so good! We mingled over the small plates and enjoyed our cocktails (Star-Crossed Lover, I will be back for you!). Our attentive server came back a couple of times to see if we needed anything, just the right touch to feel she is around should we need her.    For the entrees, we ordered the fried chicken, Mediterrenean seabass, prime rib short rib, foie gras bibimbap, and potato-crusted salmon. We also ordered the shishito peppers, and charred brocolli. All the dishes were on point, especially the crispy rice edges and generous foie gras on the bibimbap. I thought the salmon was a little over, but my friends thought it was perfect. But the fried chicken, unforgettable! Why is it called fermented hot sauce? It should be named, 'hot, lush and silky sauce.'   We come to the end, my most favorite part! We got the banana budino and cheesecake brulee. I know, why only two?! We were quite full but didn't want to leave without trying dessert. The cheesecake with the tart passionfruit bite was amazing! And the banana budino, why can't they sell that by the quart? It's like eating a very grown up pudding, so delicious and satisfying. It was really a great ending to a perfect meal.More"

Our group all ordered the tasting menu. We were having a wonderful time during our first three courses, but then our waitress disappeared and another course was not in sight. After 45 minutes, found our waitress and...she said our fish would be right up. Five minutes later, it appeared. But then, another wait. I got up to stretch my legs because we’d been sitting so long. I caught the eye of the manager, and our next course finally arrived. They sent us two pieces of dessert to split among the four of us as an apology. I was disappointed that the waitress didn’t come over and explain the delay instead of disappearing. She also should have managed the kitchen better, or brought us some bread to keep us entertained.More"

First, the most authentic, personable and kind service team ever.  Next, the dining room and music are super hip and comfortable. But best of all is the food, and at moderate prices for the freshness, quality and portion size.    We came...for brunch with our party of five adults, and four of us ordered the $29 three course tasting menu and shared that among the five of us. You get a choice of 4 items with each course, so we each picked something different and shared. Do the math, and we each tasted a dozen items!  EVERY single item was amazing and notable, and I don’t regret a bite...but I might skip dinner tonight as the portions are solid and the food so delicious that you don’t want to send a plate back empty. We double ordered the lobster dumplings, which are a reasonable a la carte option at $16. YUM!!! Order a biscuit when you are seated to share between every two people—incredible! If you order separate items, consider the maiitake mushrooms, cucumber salad, deviled eggs, short rib hash, fried chicken, coconut pancakes...everything!  You can only go right here and can’t go wrong.  I hear dinner is even better, and I don’t know how, but I can hardly wait to find out!More"

The awesome experience actually started from the phone call. I called and talked with Matthew. I explained that we didn't have reservations but...were very close in the area and would like to have dinner there. He explained that a few seats were available in the bar but if that was no longer a option, he would work his magic to accommodate us. And work his magic, he did. I think Matthew provided us with one of the best tables in the house. He greeted us so warmly when we arrived. Matthew introduced us to our server, Santiago. Santiago was an absolute gem! There are some folks who absolutely love their job, I think that would be an accurate description of Santiago. He made us laugh, engaged us in great conversation and served us some amazing food! Wait, I cannot forget about the EXTENSIVE and jaw dropping wine list! I had a Lambrusco Rose that was tantalizing! Thank you Stephen Gillanders for allowing us into your kitchen and taking photos with us. Your vision of S.K.Y. is a beam of light shining in the Pilsen neighborhood!   The food was an all star event! From the amuse bouche' to the make your taste buds dance desserts. Everything we ate that night was a topic for conservation. I don't think there are enough adjectives to describe the amazing experience I had there. What I learned at S.K.Y. is that you are supposed to experience and taste food and flavors, not just eat it. I learned that each bite is something to be savored. I learned that each appetizer or entree' presented is an event to be discussed and conversed about. I learned to truly enjoy my food.More"

This bad@ss restaurant in the hot new restaurant row (it seems) of the Pilsen neighborhood is not to be missed. How cute is this? I watch Steve Dolinsky from the Hungry Hound on abc7 Chicago introduce Stephen Gillanders' new solo spot by making me salivate every step of the foie gras bibimbap away. Picking my jaw of drool up off the floor I mention to the partner in crime in passing that we NEED to go there....Fast forward to Valentines Day, we're driving to a dinner, and I have no idea where, he surprises me! I don't even realize where the heck I am until I see the menu (btw, there was no sign outside that I saw, nor was the moniker on the menu - sneaky guy).... I see the bibimbap and I melt into the banquette. I love, I love, I love.... The decorum: Industrial, concrete, dark wood finished tables, exposed brick and ducts.The vibe: chill/ ambient/ relaxing - BYOB for a $20 corkage feeOur server: Patrick C. - awesome dudeFood: OMG Lobster Dumplings (this man can do them in his sleep), see his Windy City Live episode? Ahhh... Good sized portion of 4 delicate buttery chunks of lobster, tasty and light. Chervil, mint, chives - jade butter sauce is a little broken and the mint could have been a better chiffonade (I had some hanging out in my teeth). Flavor is spot on. Only thought, maybe a touch of acidity for balance.Chicken & Coconut Soup - move over any Tom Ka Gai soup I've ever had. With kaffir lime, ginger and shiitake mushrooms. I might like to die swimming in this velvety broth. Temperature is very hot, just the correct amount of spice heat, chicken remains juicy still in the broth (my biggest peeve with most of these style soups), the citrus is a balanced addition. Salmon - Not your ordinary salmon. Seared lightly, poached, phyllo shards act as a crust (talk about handcrafted and executed with love). Sambal - Chinese five spice butter sauce, charred and tasty broccolini. Foie Gras Bibimbap with charred veggies, mushroom bulgogi, and crispy rice on the bottom of a very hot clay bowl! All components marry well and really embraced a bag of techniques and skill. I couldn't stop loving that crispy dark rice on the bottom, oh the textural heaven.There was a special Valentines devils food cake that was okay, but didn't blow my mind. I did enjoy the Banana Budino though. I am a Nancy Silverton budding lover at heart, and this was a diversion. Good flavor, and oh that salted crunch from the granola and the cacao nibs! All in all, great for foodies, so much to pick from, and it's affordable! Move over overrated Restaurant Row, Pilsen is packing a punch!"

Because of the distance from the actual bar it felt disjointed if you wanted to have a cocktail while waiting and took some time to get a menu....but when the menu arrived we were seated at our table so all is good...It was Thursday and thankfully i remembered to bring along a nice white wine from home knowing it was BYOB Thursday yay! We ordered the truffle croquettes as a starter as well as the japanese cucumbers. The croquettes didn't last long before devoured. Subtle truffle flavor was nice and the croquettes overall were very light..the jalapeno adding just the right kick at the end. The cucumbers were reported to be good as well..refreshing. We then got the Sea Bass and the FoisGras Bibimbop. The sea bass...simple in presentation but grilled to a crusty flaking consistency with the greens underneath. My bibimbop..even after my fois was macerated and mixed into the bowl was almost lost amongst the other outstanding ingredients comprising the bowl. Besides that it was still soul satisfying. The star however of the meal was the Chocolate and Marshmallow dessert. perfectly mimicking a s'more.....the hardened caramel sauce frozen on top of the the toasted marshmallow..the marshmallow sitting on top of a brownie and then the salted caramel ice cream on the side. decadent in every way...SKY did hit all the boxes. Our server was great and kept a watchful eye over us the entire meal and always with a smile.

We also got the fried chicken and Berkshire Pork Chop. Both main dishes were really good and such a balance between a bit of spice and deliciousness.

The location is a difficult one for parking if you are out like we were on a Friday evening. Getting a reservation still means driving around till you...find a place to park. Drop off your guests first at the restaurant before starting the hunt for a vacant spot.  The drinks were good and were on the expensive side, The Secrets of Dynasties was an intriguing drink ($15.00) that I had requested without sugar or simple syrup (I don't advise omitting these!) Two glasses of red wine set us back $24.00. Our son had the Lagar Albarino ($11.00).  The food was very well made but small in portions keeping up with the advertised French-Vietnamese theme. The sauces in the food were well blended and reduced and the taste was superb. We had the vegetarian papaya salad, two orders of grilled eggplant, Thai curry in a coconut sauce, and two orders of fried rice that had a very welcome crunch and went very well with the smokes and grilled eggplants in a garlic sauce as well as the coconut-based curry.  For a party of four, the final bill without the tip came to $142.56. Spendy, enjoyable but not something we would do every weekend!More"

I love HaiSous.  I have been three times over the past few months.  On each visit, the restaurant has impressed with its superb food, exciting cocktails, and excellent service.

The space is welcoming and vibrant.  Tables are fairly close together and it's loud, but not so loud as to be unpleasant.  It feels very casual and yet contemporary; the decor benefits the cuisine.  Service has been superb on each visit, with servers knowledgeable about the menu and happy to make recommendations about what to order.  On all but our third visit, pacing of the courses has been spot-on (on our third visit, a bit too many things came out at-once).  The food is the star.  It is absolutely fantastic modern Vietnamese, exploding with flavor.  It's food that fills you, surprises you, and makes you smile!  Favorites have included the papaya salad (with shockingly delicious tofu jerky), chicken wings (sticky but worth it), the Hanoi-style pork, seafood in coconut broth, and the vegetarian Vietnamese curry.  It's also a great place to go with a group; portions are large enough to easily share, and the menu had a great variety of dishes with beef & pork, seafood, and vegetarian options.

Drop off your guests first at the restaurant before starting the hunt for a vacant spot.  The drinks were good and were on the expensive side, The Secrets of Dynasties was an intriguing drink ($15.00) that I had requested without sugar or simple syrup (I don't advise omitting these!) Two glasses of red wine set us back $24.00. Our son had the Lagar Albarino ($11.00).  The food was very well made but small in portions keeping up with the advertised French-Vietnamese theme. The sauces in the food were well blended and reduced and the taste was superb. We had the vegetarian papaya salad, two orders of grilled eggplant, Thai curry in a coconut sauce, and two orders of fried rice that had a very welcome crunch and went very well with the smokes and grilled eggplants in a garlic sauce as well as the coconut-based curry.  For a party of four, the final bill without the tip came to $142.56. Spendy, enjoyable but not something we would do every weekend!More"

The Chicago Cellar Boys (they have at least one other band name) play every Sunday from 8 to 11 PM; and there...is no cover charge. The usual three sets, the usual loud bar environment, but a relatively good room layout for music (high ceiling, suitable band stage). I could go on and rave about the band, but suffice to say that they are in the very top tier of bands of this style anywhere in the U.S. There was a coterie of youngish adults who obviously came to hear this group, some in vintage attire and a very few trying their hand at lindy and balboa dancing.  I ate only two appetizers (eating light this night). The hot link was wonderfully tasty; very nicely seasoned. The garlic-mashed potatoes were fine. Service was prompt. There is a full bar. Interestingly, all of the (male) servers had full beards. There seems to be a back room where music would be less loud. It seems they have live music almost every night. I used the #60 bus to get to and from, and I thought that was fine, even with a five-block walk in the dark (no moon) between the restaurant and bus stops. I went on a late-August night and noted that there seems to be no air-conditioning; so, it was a little sticky in there. I’m not a big fan of beef or chicken, so I am no judge of most BBQ, but the servings that I saw carried out from the kitchen looked quite ample. The prices including for drinks seemed quite reasonable, and a minor snafu about my first drink was promptly remedied. I would definitely go back to this place again to try the pork BBQ and some kind of “bacon candy” (which is apparently a specialty), and highly recommend anyone with interest in American music to go hear this band on a Sunday evening. If I could give two ratings, I’d give four stars to this BBQ restaurant, and five for this very talented small orchestra.More"

There is an on-site ATM and there is a well stocked liquor store right across the street if needed (bring your own cork screw or bottle opener).

The Arrachera (Grilled Skirt Steak) Tacos were juicy, flavorful and flame-grilled. They were served with my absolute favorite, ""commercially available"" Spanish rice in all of Chicago. (That's right Abuelita, you're still ¡Número uno!) Service was some kind of wonderful. Without prompting, my guest and I were provided with a small ice bucket and sliced limes for the 6-pack of Modelo Especial we brought in with us to this BYOB-friendly establishment. Throughout the night, we realized we would be trading off one metric of great service for an interactive, playful night to remember. We noticed that perhaps not all of the formal, steps of service enjoyed at a Michelin star ranked restaurant were being performed during dinner. However, we enjoyed an entirely warmer, more intimate dining experience that would include the owner, the cooks and even several guests we met throughout the night as we sang 'Las Mañanitas' every time the cow bell rang out and the lights went dim. Service, and especially hospitality, came in the form of a genuine appreciation for this lovingly rustic, communal & cultural connection versus being impressed by a single server's food & wine IQ or timely, technical precision. In the end, I strongly recommend this local, instant classic, enjoying citywide fame as it was recently named among ""Chicago's 12 Essential Mexican Restaurants"" by Eater Chicago. Their menu does not include the price hikes being charged by many of the area's boutique-style taquerias cashing in on the neighborhood's rise in popularity and median salary of single professionals drawn to Pilsen's eclectic beauty. Instead, Cantón Regio enjoys a loyal following of guests willing to wait upwards of an hour for an open table on any given evening because of the loyalty the family has given back to its evolving barrio. Despite obvious upgrades to its venue, its style of service and dinner menu offerings, the family has kept its cultural, ""Mi casa, Su casa"" belief system with approachable prices for every occasion enjoyed by local regulars, new neighbors and Chicago foodies like us. ¡Muchas gracias!

We were familiar with Nuevo Leon restaurant across the street that burned down and when they moved here to Canton, I think they brought along an improved menu and great spirit."

In the Pilsen neighborhood of Chicago, this newer northern Mexican restaurant is a true departure from your typical Mexican food experience. The evening we visited, the serving staff wore T-shirts bearing the words authentico, sabor (flavorful), and tradicional and I couldn't agree more. No bland, gooey enchiladas buried in refried beans here! Instead we found very savory and perfectly spiced mesquite-grilled meats and vegetables and a cozy and friendly atmosphere.Walking in from a driving, cold rain on a Saturday night, we were quickly shown to a table in the back of the restaurant where we could watch the action in the open kitchen. Hector, our very attentive and informative waiter, immediately greeted us with freshly made chips, an assortment of three salsas, and opened our bottle of wine. (Yes, on top of great food this is BYOB!) While all the dishes we saw being carried out looked fantastic, we decided on a combination of three skewers - beef, chicken, and shrimp - and the 1/2 kilo of the Arrachera (grilled skirt steak), with sides of Mexican rice and charro beans. The entrees are served with grilled sweet peppers, spring onions, and jalapeno peppers, as well as warm, freshly made tortillas. Everything was delicious, perfectly cooked and spiced, though my favorites were the Arrachera, the charro beans and the shrimp skewers. Portions are generous, and while it was too much food for the two of us, we were glad we had a chance to try an assortment of dishes. What we couldn't finish was packed up for us to take home. All for very reasonable $35 tab. (It's cash-only here, but they have an ATM machine in-house if you forget) Thank you, Canton Regio, for a terrific evening. We will see you again soon!"

The beignets were light and fluffy, the raspberry sauce is really good. Now the Chocolate Waffles, the waffles themselves were ok, not amazing tasting, but not terrible. I think they try to make the matter with chocolate but the flavor does not come thru, so they try overwhelm the flavor with Chocolate sauce on top of the waffles. for me it was too much. if you are not into that flavor i would make mention to take it easy on the chocolate drizzle. it also comes with fresh cut bananas and strawberry and a small scoop of vanilla ice cream.

Monnie Burke's was open and had valet parking, so gave it a shot. The food start to finish was disappointing. The diet coke ordered before ordering food did not arrive until after the food....We were not charged for it because we told them it lacked carbonation. The salad did not come ahead of time. When it did, it did not have both kinds of greens (only spinach, no gem) and the buttermilk vinaigrette was so thin it barely coated the greens, and did not have a buttermilk tang. The ribeye steak was not ribeye. While we recognized the difference ourselves, the only confirmation from the kitchen or server was a reduction in the price. The meat was on the chewy side but the fries were outstanding.  The short rib was marbled with thick fat that, in my experience, normally cooks off during many hours in the oven, so assume it did not get the hours advertised. Since it was cooked in marrow, the finished meat was unusually greasy for short rib. Definitely not a value at $31. On the way in, the valet and host were especially friendly and accommodating.

And the restaurant itself has a great vibe. It's quite large and the space is divided between a large old fashioned dark wood bar area, a large brick sided patio (in the back...of the restaurant) and a side dining room that is open on one full side to the patio. So there are lots of spaces to pick from. We were seated on the patio next to a group of women having a baby shower, and there was another large group of 20 or more people in the indoor dining room. It looks like a great place for large groups, while still feeling like you are in an intimate space.  We were there for brunch on a Sunday morning and to be honest, no one had a good meal. Two of us had the avocado toast. When you order avocado toast you are thinking that avocado would be a primary element. Instead it is just a thin smear of avocado on bread -- which should also be fabulous since it is a primary ingredient. But this bread was thick, tasteless, actually a detriment to the dish. The scrambled eggs were fine.  My son had the chicken and waffles. He said the chicken tasted like frozen chicken tenders. Not a good thing. And since frozen chicken tenders were his favorite food when he was little, I expect he knows what he is talking about. My husband had a burger with avocado which was again just a schmear of avocado. I think his burger was basically fine but nothing to push the rating up.  It seems like a nice place visually, the service was good. But the food was a notch below average.More"

Buts...it's fantastic , very basic, plastic plates,paper towels at the table but what you immediately notice when you enter is an truly enormous pile of various cuts of roast pork and vast rolls of puffed pork scratching ( or frijoles ). It's cash only. The menu is basic certainly in the week it's roast pork, brown or white meat, ribs stomach or skin, you choose what you want. A pile of tortillas arrive along with re fried beans & a bowl of chopped onion & coriander, a bowl of jalapeños and you tuck in!! We had a 1/2 portion and could barely finish, with 2 cokes just over $14. Brilliant value and the meat was beautiful. I think there's more choice of meat on the weekend. As I said it's not that appealing on the outside but the food is great and the atmosphere is that of a busy local family restaurant. I am really hoping to get back before I leave Chicago.More"

Drove by the place, not knowing really where to go, and saw the double-parked cars, a long...line and smiling faces leaving the front door and I knew that this was the place to go.  Waited in line for about 15 minutes to get my order, but it was worth it.  Carnitas del cielo!  They give you a huge sampler hunk of meat when you order.  Also got a pound of the Chicharron.  They also have seating, maybe five or six tables.  They have goat meat, and brain tacos and of course, since it’s Sunday they have Munedo.  Bunch of other stuff that I didn’t recognize.  We didn’t try any of that, just got Carnitas and pork rinds to go, but everything there looked delicious and everyone there looked like they were very happy.  Cash only!  All folks from the neighborhood, as far as I could tell, including some authentic looking Sinaloa Cowboys with belt buckles as big as a plate!  So, north-siders, get off your couch, forget about that Avant Garde hipster Mexican fusion place on Lincoln Ave, get into your Subaru and hit the southside for the real thing.

Not minding the wait I gave my order,  took my number & found a table.  Lobby tables are now surrounded in Plexi-glass, ok again no biggie but I saw people crawl out of these"" Pods"" after their meals & others sit after a server ,ever so gently & no where near thorough enough , passed a rag across the table...hmm.  Still  I made the choice to stick it out & stay in a ""Pod-Free"" zone. The equally as rude & very abrupt server ever so roughly bangs my food onto the table which may or nay not have been gently passed over with a rag🙄 As she quickly scurried away I look down at my plate only to discover it's not my food she threw but that of some other unsuspecting customer. As I yell for the running server  I note the 27 minutes I've already been there. My server advises me that I must go back to Rude worker #1 & advise him of his mistake 🤨I explain my order as entered on my receipt is ok but the shaken mess on my plate is, (in my very slow hear me voice) not my order  Rude worker #2 advises me again ( in her rude ""Because I said so voice) to go back to Mr. RUDE #1.   NRXRUDE #1 advises me that in order to fix MY PROBLEM  I would have to get back in line. With my head bowed from being scolded by these 2  I glance up only to see the line extends outside the door & once outside there was a Hangry  mob that stretched for as far as the eye could see. Now with my frozen tussled food I slowly inch my way back to my frightful place in line. Once I find my place as the sun starts to fall a very friendly equally Hangry customer says ""you shouldn't have to wait in line. Go back in & tell them you would like what you paid for ! Well, me & my new found confidence walk past the Parade of Hangry patrons & enter the lion's den again. I apologized to the very nice Hangry patron at the register & preceeded to plead, & beg,   my case. Mr. Rude #1 has now officially had enough of me & orders Miss Rude #3 to bring me my order. Mystery plate disappears only to reappear a few minutes later with previously tossed around beans & Ensalada😤But it's late,  duty calls so I grin & bear it !Meat is warm & flavorless,  tortillas are now stiff cold rememberanc of a tortilla & the previously tossed around Ensalada is no longer Ensalada but instead a food processor cut poor sour & bitter excuse for what used to be a great product!

Situated on a corner of the main drag in Pilsen the bar has a small outdoor patio area and plenty of indoor seating. There’s an alternative vibe about the place, with retro kung-fu movies playing (silently) on the small TV at the bar, industrial furniture and classic tunes from the late 90’s punctuating the buzz of conversation.I’ve never been asked to leave both a credit card and an ID behind the bar to run a tab… apparently too many folks have ordered on mystery credit cards and fled, but that aside the service was friendly and attentive.And now for the food… oh, boy! I left full, happy and with only a small dent in the wallet. Actually the Mrs. paid, but that’s another story. The tune steak sandwich was SO good and the mixed fries were delicious. With eats like that and the great selection of craft beers on tap (Stone Coffee Porter anyone?) I’m definitely planning on coming back soon!"

Upon my inquiry with one of the staff, we were told that the back bar would fill up later in the night. The main dining area was about 35% filled and although the bar was crowded, we managed to get two seats. Our bartender was friendly and poured decent cocktails, but the quality of the house wine was average and overpriced. We ate at the bar and had a plate of empanadas and a hamburger. Both dishes were just fair. This restaurant caters to younger patrons and plays loud, recorded, contemporary music that hinders conversation.

We understand that this is part of the Covid-19 issue since they don’t have the selling volume and the fruits go bad. I had tripe tacos and they were crunchy and a bit dry. The suadero was soft instead of crunchy and greasy as it used to be. The steak one were average. The red and green sauce were tasty and had a good spice to them. The Horchata was as satisfying as I remember with the balance combination of rice and sweetness. The carrots, onions, cauliflower and peppers we’re amazing!

The pickled vegetables were fantastic. The yuca and carrot were spiced up by the peppers and delicious. The peppers were hot, but not burn your lips off hot. They were good eaten straight.Our burritos were some of the best we have had. We got the with ""everything"" without asking what that meant. I saw lettuce, onion, sour cream and cilantro I think. The Tamazula hot sauce worked well with the burritos as well as the table salsa verde and salsa rojo.The staff was friendly and helpful. I speak just enough Spanish to get by in a restaurant. I highly recommend Los Comales."

For one, it's open very late in contrast to any other restaurants so the sheer convenience is a plus. The price of a taco dinner (steak with onion and cilantro) and beans and rice on the side is extremely reasonable. I think it's around $7 or $8. I also love the peppers on the table and the chips and salsa at the start. The quality of the food is not as good as some other spots in the area but it doesn't stop me from eating there whatsoever because it's still good and so reasonable. Definitely worth trying! "

I've been to a few dozen Mexican restaurants in Chicago from the north side to the south side to Maywood and more. The rice and beans, arbol salsa, meats, and old school atmosphere/service at this restaurant are second to none. If you need the fastest service possible, go elsewhere, you might not get it here. That said, the service is excellent, friendly, hospitable, and simply very enjoyable. Honestly, i'm not looking to get in and out of my favorite place to eat as fast as i possibly can! Order, sit down and enjoy your food, and pay when finished. Complaints about service for this restaurant in other reviews on other websites make no sense to me. People who want Taco Bell service and the best food possible will never be happy.The food is excellent, top notch. I could totally love a meal of nothing more than their rice, beans, incredible salsa de arbol, and maybe some guacamole. To make this meal over the top, i get one or two of their tacos. I'm addicted to their ""rez in chile de arbol"", which is beef long/slow cooked in their amazing arbol salsa. This particular meat is extremely tender, somewhat hot, and has a wonderful chile flavor. I've tried several of their tacos, and everythings is very simple, rich, and excellent. Their beans are the best i've ever had anywhere- quite rich being made with lard (lots of it).I could go on about how much i love going to this place. You get the idea. Check it out."

I've been to a few dozen Mexican restaurants in Chicago from the north side to the south side to Maywood and more. The rice and beans, arbol salsa, meats, and old school atmosphere/service at this restaurant are second to none. If you need the fastest service possible, go elsewhere, you might not get it here. That said, the service is excellent, friendly, hospitable, and simply very enjoyable. Honestly, i'm not looking to get in and out of my favorite place to eat as fast as i possibly can! Order, sit down and enjoy your food, and pay when finished. Complaints about service for this restaurant in other reviews on other websites make no sense to me. People who want Taco Bell service and the best food possible will never be happy.The food is excellent, top notch. I could totally love a meal of nothing more than their rice, beans, incredible salsa de arbol, and maybe some guacamole. To make this meal over the top, i get one or two of their tacos. I'm addicted to their ""rez in chile de arbol"", which is beef long/slow cooked in their amazing arbol salsa. This particular meat is extremely tender, somewhat hot, and has a wonderful chile flavor. I've tried several of their tacos, and everythings is very simple, rich, and excellent. Their beans are the best i've ever had anywhere- quite rich being made with lard (lots of it).I could go on about how much i love going to this place. You get the idea. Check it out."

If you are with a large party, you have to be careful because the table order comes on 1-2 plates and you have to figure out which tacos belong to you.   My only disappointment was the margaritas.

House margaritas (I always try the house margarita first) were very flavorful with a good sour/sweet balance. We started with the ceviche, which was fresh and very good. The Pilsen and Big Boss tacos were our favorites. Really good service at the bar and they were mindful of our tight schedule. Be sure to check age requirement before going if young ones are with you.

The drinks:  their drinks pack a good punch; I am not complaining but some may as the alcohol taste overwhelms the fruits and mixes.  The frozen strawberry margarita was awesome and the mango on the rocks was tasty. Couple of things... first, no one under 18 is allowed so please keep this in mind when visiting and with whom.

Servings are generous. Watch out for the salsas that come with the corn chips as they can be a bit fiery for some! The burritos are huge. You can choose which tacos you want from a list. Margaritas go well with the food and are big. Best is the melted cheese to share. Yummy!!

Although the party ordered all at the same time, the food came out 35 plus minutes apart. While some of the party waited to receive their food, the remaining party, whose food had been served, waited idly as their food got cold. I requested to see the manager to explain the issue with service, and he (joe) proceeded to argue with me regarding the delay and how long we actually waited to receive our food. He also walked away mid conversation. I come to La Vaca often-- at least twice monthly-- and the service has been on a steady decline. In addition, the waitstaff did not buss the table in a timely manner. I won't return and am contacting the better business bureau regarding my complaint and manager joe's cavalier attitude."

Chips and salsa are standard, and we added a table guacamole, which was amazing. The restaurant offered a vast variety of tacos, and each is $2.50 on Tuesday. We ordered 4-5 tacos each of varying flavors … from Cerveza to Pollo to Lomito. My absolute favorite was the Big Boss (breaded shrimp, bacon, coleslaw, avocado, and chipotle mayo). If you are with a large party, you have to be careful because the table order comes on 1-2 plates and you have to figure out which tacos belong to you. My only disappointment was the margaritas. We tried a pitcher of passion fruit and a second pitch of lime. Both lacked flavor (and alcohol) in my opinion. The final bill was $102 before tip. I would definitely go again on a Tuesday, but would choose a different drink."
