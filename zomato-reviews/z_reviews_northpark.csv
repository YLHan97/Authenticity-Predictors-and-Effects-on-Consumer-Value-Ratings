What a hidden gem! I saw a picture of the mouthwatering bread pudding French toast and had to try it. I love a good chorizo skillet, so I wanted to try that too!

Tre Kronor,https://www.zomato.com/chicago/tre-kronor-north-park/reviews,"Feb 08, 2018",4,"We had never been in Midway Airport in Chicago. It had been a long day and we wanted to eat in a regular restaurant. I had in mind the seafood restaurant at National Airport. As we walked through the terminal Harry Caray seemed to be the only sit-down restaurant. There was a line which I hoped was a good sign. At the entrance were several dower appearing wait staff who were writing down names. I left my name and joined the waiting crowd. I went back and asked if there were menus to look at. One of the hostesses silently and expressionlessly handed me a menu. I thought to myself, ‘not a good sign’, but as I scanned the area again, it was either this place or fast food. After about half an hour, our name was called and we were offered seats at a high top table in the bar area. I requested a regular table in the dining area and was told it would be a few minutes. Near the door was a table for two that was clean and ready; a nearby table had a handicap sign on it, but this particular table did not. I did not say anything. We watched the hostess seat several people at tables for two in the dining area, so I asked if we had been forgotten. The hostess replied, ‘yes’ and apologized and then sat us at the table that had been ready all along.",Simran Pande,37960120,33461088,DINING

Tre Kronor,https://www.zomato.com/chicago/tre-kronor-north-park/reviews,"Apr 16, 2015",4.5,"Tre Kronor:. Välkommen to Tre Kronor where you will find some of the best Scandinavian home cooking in Chicago. Tre Kronor is a cozy and casual restaurant with Swedish and Norwegian memorabilia like Niklas Hjalmarsson’s Blackhawks jersey and mural of dancing elves covering the walls.  On a mission for a meatball sandwich I got the Norwegian Meatball sandwich served open-faced made with hot gravy on limpa toast a Swedish rye bread that has a sweet taste. The meatball sandwich can also be served cold with egg and tomato. You can get the delicious bread at the Swedish Bakery in Andersonville. For the side option you should order the house made pickled cucumbers. They are crunchy full of dill and have a sweat and sour tang of vinegar.  The special of the day was pølse a boiled sausage from Denmark served in a bun covered in mashed potatoes and topped off with crispy onions and served with a salad. It’s worth it to break your diet for this special.  The cinnamon roll has a nice citron flavor and is big enough to share. Tre Kronor also serves a great breakfast and dinner. If you want to continue the Scandinavian good times you can cross the street to The Sweden Shop a department store with housewares, clothing, and books from Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Finland.",Alicia Lauhon,29337318,23647768,DINING

Who knew a big plate of hot breakfast meats could be be like a perfect story? The corned beef hash and eggs isn't unique to the Swedish angle on this bistro, but it's gotta be one of the best : homemade and served with Limpa (mild swedish rye). Guaranteed to whip some light magic into my day any time.  Not that this is the only reason to show up to ""Trey-Kay,"" as the locals call it. Everything from the brie and red-pepper quiche to the orange french toast will similarly walk you to a happy place, and though breakfast is the thing, the lunch menu reuben sandwich is hard to ignore.  Albany park locals and especially the faculty and staff of North Park University (across the street) are often here, but stories of people traveling much further aren't uncommon. Just be prepared to wait--some mornings the tiny dining room can't handle the flood of friends who want Swedish breakfast to lift their day.

Hoanh Long Vietnamese & Chinese Restaurant,https://www.zomato.com/chicago/hoanh-long-north-park/reviews,"Jun 02, 2015",4,"  Do restaurants get better or do you get to know the menu more intimately?  Often I write a review immediately after going to a restaurant especially when I don't think I'll return either because it was not a satisfactory experience or because it is pretty far off my beaten path.  I am very familiar with Vietnamese food having eaten it all over the world, including Viet Nam. I 've made the pilgrimage to Argyle many times (mostly to Hai Yen). Do I think Hoanh Long is an authentic Vietnamese experience? I'd call it an authentic Vietnamese-Chinese experience (remember the Chinese occupied Viet Nam for 1000 years).  I held off on Hoanh Long primarily because there were already many reviews. But the last few meals there have been so good I know the time has come.  We have been to Hoanh Long 7 or 8 times and each is better than the last. The chef has a deft touch with spice rack; his dishes are spicy without burning the tongue.  Start with Goi Cuon (shrimp spring roll), two thick fresh cold rolls stuffed with shrimp and vegetables served with a spicy penult sauce and/or the Banh Xeo (Crepe with shrimp, pork and salad). Move on to their superb Pho (noodle soup) in a variety of forms (beef, seafood, chicken, etc.) served with a plate of fresh veggies (be sure to taste the broth alone ... it really rocks). Move on to the not so spicy Ga Xoa THap Cam (stir fried chicken and vegetables), the spicy shrimp and lobster sauce (not the Cantonese version), Mi Xao Thap Cam (stir fried egg noodles with combination of seafood, meat and vegetables) and/or any of their Com Chien (fried rice).  A truly stellar dish is Chem Chep Xao Cay (stir fried mussels in a fiery sauce). When we had it last they were huge green lipped mussels from New Zealand.  Yes, restaurants do get better the more you know them and Hoanh Long truly is worth getting to know intimately.",Gilbert Zoghlin,20620120,23877497,DINING

It was spectacular and earns two very enthusiastic thumbs up. The Bo Bop Khau was the perfect start, with tender, perfectly marinated beef atop a delicious melange of baby papaya and carrots. We tracked the beautiful presentation of the Muc Sate Hoanh Long at an adjoining table and followed suit, adding the Mi Xao Thap Cam. Fabulous choices. And I likely will have the leftovers for dinner for the next two days. I can't remember when I enjoyed a restaurant this much.

I went through the drive through around 9:00am and ordered two charcoal double burgers and a gyros plate. I paid 22.50 for my meal and drove off. Two minutes later still in the car I opened up my first double burger. I picked it up and it was soaked in grease! I held it up for at least 4 minutes and the grease just kept flowing off. The burger was sopping wet and hard. I called and asked for the manager and Angelo picked up. I asked Angelo how my burger was cooked. He said it was cooked on a flat top grill. Excuse me your restaurant is called Charcoal Delight, your menu says CHARCOAL BURGER. Why am I being served a flat top grilled burger? Well Angelo says they don’t turn on their charcoal grill until around 9:30. I said you should have told me that I would never have ordered these burgers! I told him about the insane amounts of grease and first he says that it’s just the juice from the burger. I tell him I’ve had burgers and there is a difference between GREASE and fat/juices from the burger. Then he tries to tell me the heat from the burger in the container makes the buns squishy. I said the buns were not squishy it was when I picked up the burger it dripped a full stream of grease for several minutes. Then he starts calling me lady and little girl. He also talks over me the entire conversation when I try to speak. I point out he is talking over me and he says, “No I’m not.” Then proceeds to talk over me again and I point it out to him, he just kept talking. He says, “What do you want me to do?” I said I wanted a refund for my burgers, which I had asked for several times (while he talked over me). He says, “That’s all you had to ask for then!” Then he tells me he will write down my credit card number and refund me later then THROW OUT THE PAPER WITH MY NUMBER ON IT!!!!!!!!! I said, “You can’t throw out a credit card number in the trash!!” He says something like, “Oh just my luck with this lady today” (Or something to that effect). I am not about to have my credit card number taken from your trash (or one of your employees) and have tons of fraudulent charges from it, incredibly irresponsible.  So listen:  1. FALSE ADVERTISEMENT OF CHARCOAL BURGER  2. INCREDIBLY RUDE AND DEMEANING MANAGER ANGELO   3. WANTS TO THROW OUT MY CREDIT CARD NUMBER IN THE TRASH  All of these things I find unacceptable.
