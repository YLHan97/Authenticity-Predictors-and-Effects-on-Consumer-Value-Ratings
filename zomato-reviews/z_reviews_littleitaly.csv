The garlic bread was excellent. Well toasted, slightly crispy and garlicky served with marinara sauce and parmesan. The Bolognese was very very delicious but very rich so the portions seemed heavy.

La Taberna Tapas on Halsted,https://www.zomato.com/chicago/la-taberna-tapas-university-village/reviews,"Apr 08, 2018",1,"This place is a joke. My fiancee and I were planning on having our wedding reception here, being that it was to be a small wedding and planned very quickly. The chef who we dealt with was very accommodating, and we had a verbal agreement with everything we wanted.   Before we had a chance to draft up a formal contract, we found out that the chef had quit and we were to deal with another one of the managers there. After we got worried we were going to have to rework out our deal, he told us we had nothing to worry about, the original terms would be honored, and he would get the contract together.   Literally one week before our wedding, the owner of the restaurant calls my fiancee' and would not agree to anything near what was agreed upon, wanting to charge us nearly double of what we were originally promised. He knew we were in a very difficult position and tried to take advantage of us. This is a horrible way to conduct business and no matter how much it ruined our wedding, I was not going to let this man hold us hostage. We found another restaurant literally 4 DAYS before the wedding and made the most of a bad situation.   I wish the story would end there, but unfortunately it does not. Since we put a $1000 deposit down on a credit card, we received a check from the restaurant reimbursing the money. The maid of honor, however, was not as lucky. She wrote them a check for $300 to help with the liquor cost, and we were returned the check, as the restaurant claimed they did not cash it. Only it turns out they did. When we confronted the owner about this, he claims we were given ""cash"" back and not the check. How he knew this, we have no idea... we never even met him in person. We dealt with the manager, who it turns out doesn't even work there anymore either! He refused to give her the money back and literally told us ""do what you want about it"" and hung up on us, knowing full well it is our word against his, and it would not be worth taking him to court over $300. After months of attempting to meet in person with him and not having any luck, we have given up.  This man is not worthy of owning a restaurant and I encourage others to stay away from this place. Someone of his character does not deserve your business. I am not one to write reviews, but I needed to tell my story. If for whatever reason you need to plan a party with this place, ensure you get everything in writing and sign a contract the MINUTE you have a deal to avoid their shady business practices.

One of the things you should do is try some of the local specialties when it's time to eat.   Portillo's is a local chain, which has spread out to a few other states to accommodate retirees who have fled our delightful winters. Warren Buffet bought the chain for some ungodly amount of money. Hopefully, this was merely to secure a steady stream of cheese fries for the ""Oracle of Omaha"" and the quality of the food will remain high.   Ok. For starters, brace yourself to be overwhelmed by kitsch. That's ok. Tourists and kids love it. Second, follow the lines to oder. Third, the food is going to take a while to prepare. They'll call out your receipt number when the food is ready.   May I suggest a few items from the menu?  Italian Beef -- Not very Italian. I've never seen anything like it in Italy. Maybe it's the collection of spices? Maybe it was sold by Italian immigrants? It is delicious. It's the best in this city. For the uninitiated, it's a serving of shaved roast beef on a six inch bun doused in the salty beef ""au jus."" I like mine with hot peppers, but you can get them with sweet pepper too. Cut it in slices and share if you'd like.   Hot dog -- Some call this sausage a Frankfurter or a Wiener. Wenn Sie deutsch sind, ähnelt diese Wurst einer Bockwurst.

My best friend Austin likes to stock up on fancified olive oil, tomatoes, giardiniera, etc. when we go there.

It has a seating for around 20 to 25 people.   The menu is full of variety for biryanis and meal combos. We orders allow sabzi chicken biryani and huge pranthas .. .. The food was above average as compared to Indian taste but being in Chicago and maintaining flavours like these is just remarkable.

I always wondered why it was so empty each time I went in there and now I think I know why. First time today (my third visit) I ordered a Shrimp Tempura Roll (sushi) and it contained no shrimp. It was basically rice, avocado , and cucumber! I mentioned it to the host/main guy at the front and he basically stood there just kinda looking at me. They didn't offer to re-make the roll and ADD SHRIMP and they didn't take it off the bill. I never complain but if Im paying $8.00 for one roll that has like 5 pieces then I expect some shrimp... It isn't much to ask for since the name of the roll is shrimp tempura.... I understand the economy is tough but jeeez! Then he came by later to ask how it is and Im like well there isn't any shrimp and I told him honestly I would not be ordering it again. LIttle did he know that I would never come back to this restaurant again. Sushi was blah ! in taste... and everything else is blah too! the chicken my friend had was dry as hell. its like they are slow so it tasted like chicken leftovers.... the spicy tuna roll is nasty as well. Maybe I went during a slow time but as a paying customer I deserve at least for him to see if I want them to re-make the roll or give me another roll instead or take it off the bill. This is why I predict this ""business"" will soon be OUT OF BUSINESS...... its only a matter of time. its always DEAD! now, i know why.   go to LALO'S instead across the street or Lucky's sanwich shop! you will get way more for your $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ !
