Declined terribly,"I gave you 2 stars due to the poor service quality especially thanks to the person serving our table. His name is Anas and he was beyond terrible.  To the Management of Al Bawadi, Your food quality has declined and we drove 20 miles to...your place for bad service and terrible food.  This guy waiting our table is a piece of work - busy socializing with his friends on the next table.   When the silverware was finally brought after repeatedly asking and reminding - this guy has the audacity to give me 1 napkin and 4 forks and spoons for 4 of us - he asks me to wipe it with the napkin and pass it on to others. 1 napkin for 4 people.   I doubt we are 'EVER' coming back just because of the pathetic service that Anas rendered.More"

I ordered lamb and filet mignon and look at the pictures, I was in utter shock to even sit there when the food...was presented before me. I have been going to albawadi since 2011 and have always enjoyed their food. But this visit made me realize that, like every other business out there, these people care about their pockets rather than their loyal patrons. I understand it's a pandemic but in the food industry the quality and quantity of the food is one area WHERE YOU DON'T CUT CORNERS.More"

Not a good idea! They used to bring complimentary Arabic coffee to the table but not...this time or even the last time.  The meat, they say the quality has not change. But I understand that now they have their own slaughter house for the lamb and beef. Its either they have a new cook or lower quality meat,  The Kabob, definitely has gristly part to it that was not removed and that made the experience very gross. I had to spit it out each time.  The Kifta Kabob was way over cooked, It was not a medium well, It was very well done, I mean over cooked, Rubbery.  The rice was cold when it came out.

I grew up in the 1950s in Blue Island, Illinois, a Chicago suburb, and the White Castle at 127th and South Western Avenue was our favorite hangout. In those days, you watched the cooks make the beloved...sliders and ate them hot and fresh off the griddle. But the menu consisted of only the original slider, a beef patty grilled on a bed of onions and stuff in a steamed bun with a pickle and dosed with ketchup, fries and Coca-Cola. If you were an early riser and wanted something for breakfast, you could get coffee and a doughnut. Nothing else. No sausage, egg and cheese. No chicken and waffles. No Jalapeno cheese slider. No western BBQ grilled chicken slider. No fish nibblers. No mozzarella cheese sticks. No bacon jam slider with smoked cheddar. No black bean slider. No cheesecake on a stick. Call me an old-timer but I've never gotten used to the new menu. In 2014, Time magazine labeled White Castle the most influential burger of all time. They were talking about the Original Slider. When we walked into the White Castle at 79th and South Harlem Avenue in southwest suburban Bridgeview, one of the busiest corners in the Chicago area, the person at the counter looked at me in a strange manner when I ordered 10 White Castles with ketchup and fries. Oh, it's the same slider that I couldn't resist in the 1950s. But it cost only 12 cents in those days. White Castle has been in business since 1921 and nobody does it better.More"

They are very expensive and you don't get a lot of food - at least the 6 dishes we ordered.  #1 Visit- We went for breakfast. Whoever said the serving is large didn't order...what I ordered. I had french toast with eggs. I left wanting more especially since my scrambled eggs tasted HORRIBLE. I've never had such poor tasting eggs in a restaurant. I actually had to mention it to the waitress and have it exchanged for runny eggs that covered my plate in mess. They don't allow you to order over hard eggs. It's the cooking oil they use that made me exchange the eggs, it made them taste nasty!   For my son, he was on the fence with ordering and the waitress offered to order a la carte. Usually they are in your best interest, but doing this our bill was so much higher than it would have been! I wish she would have warned us. Service could be better on both visits.   #2 Visit- We went for lunch. We didn't have butter, we didn't have bread plates, we had to ask to have our water filled. The lady forgot my son's milk that was included. Soup didn't taste all that great - just tasted like normal ""out of a vat"" restaurant chicken rice soup. Corned beef sandwich was a bit dry and overheated. Their food's just average at best and they use a lot of nasty cooking oil. My son hated his kid's pizza and he filled up on fries and milk. :(   On a side note the outside is ugly but the inside is beautiful.

I replied with the fact that I make steak 3 times a week and all I put on it is salt and pepper and it's not tasteless and that the steak was GRAY. So the guy just turns and storms off.

My recent trip in many years to Ihop did not leave a good taste in my mouth literally.  Let‚Äôs start with great service being...seated promptly but that was it. We were seated at a half cleaned table, sugar in between condiments, as my oldest daughter looks at flavors of syrup them drippy and sticky now in need of a napkin on top of my toddler sitting In her booster to realize the bottle of Tabasco sauce had crusty and fresh spillage and she now has in on her hands no server in site as I‚Äôm looking around. I get up from table and walk to hostess station to ask for napkins. As I observed them and realize and make eye contact with about 5 of the servers that are working they are pretty much tryin to figure out who is going to take this table. I contemplated leaving but didn‚Äôt because I knew my reason being there was for my daughter to taste birthday cake pancakes. 8-10 minutes later we finally are greeted with our server, I honestly didn‚Äôt know her name until I saw my print out receipt at end of breakfast. We place our order, pretty basic cupcake pancakes, a coffee, apple juice, iced tea. My order for myself and toddler to share was originally harvest but pancakes and she actually advised me and told me there are nuts in there I just want you to be aware so she doesn‚Äôt choke. Told her I appreciated her telling me and switched to banana stawberry - hard boiled eggs, sausage and hash browns. That‚Äôs a platter I guess. So as I begin to prepare my coffee while we wait I have no silverware non of us do. I wait until I finally say let me ask another server. I physically see this serve make me a silverware setting I probably should have just said I needed a spoon for my coffee. It wasn‚Äôt until our food came 2 cups of coffee in that I needed to ask her for silverware for us to now just eat. We start eating my daughter raving about how good her pancakes are my toddler daughter isn‚Äôt eating her eggs I see that took a bite She loves eggs. My older daughter decides she won‚Äôt eat them I will.  She take a bite and spits it out saying it tastes like lemon cleaner or like a clorax wipe mom. NOOOO Flipping was let me try it. Sure enough she hit the nail on the head my 13 year old. I‚Äôm disgusted I tell them to stop eating them. Server is doing her rounds at tables I honestly as furious as I was I just fed my daughter poison. I said politely no everything is not going well. I explained she smelled it and apologized took it to the back area where food was and proceeded to have the manager Kenya, smell it and other servers as well smell it. Kenya visited my table aggravated it seemed at first until she realized my real concern is my daughters who just ingested this food that I so confidently served my children. She offered to pay my bill which I firmly decided to pay for. Thanks again IHOP but everyone I know will know that this establishment is not the one to go to. I live merely 15 minutes away and passing many other restaurants businesses I made the wrong choice in coming into IHOP.More"

I remember going to a different location of Los Comales in 1986 or 1987! We went to the Bridgeport Comales, and I will give a positive--but mixed--review. The tacos...were good, if not spectacular... specifically,  the tacos al pastor were probably as good as you get in Chicago, but a FAR cry from the works of art that you get in dozens of spots in Mexico City. The suadero was just bits of tough meat, but had none of the flavor. The tripitas were good, apparently, but I did not get to try them (so they may have been very good!). Apart from tacos, the gorditas were quite disappointing ... a big gordita, but kinda doughy and not with the crispy, lard-laden wonders that gorditas should be. The ""taco dorado"" with potato was great, and the quesadilla de lengua was great. Service was pleasant and efficient. Sooooo, a mixed review is the best that I can do.More"

We ordered two cokes and two steak burrito dinners (rice and beans). When the food arrived, the rice and beans were cold. We took a bite of the steak burritos and we both...tasted nothing but sour cream, guacamole and lettuce. Both of us unwrapped these steak burritos and between the sour cream, lettuce, guacamole and beans, we counted maybe six or seven pieces of steak which actually looked like rabbit droppings. We immediatley went up to cashier, and told her these were the worst burritos we ever had, she provided what she thought passed as an apology as she handed me the bill for $25.00. I can safely say, WE WILL NEVER GIVE THIS PLACE A SECOND CHANCE !More"

Menus are easy to read and if you have questions, no problem.    I had the traditional 3 taco dinner; 1 beef tongue, 1 tripe and 1 steamed beef.   All melted in my mouth.  My guide ordered this drink called a horchata and was very intrigued enough to ask about it and it was explained as a sweet milk treat so I definitely had to have one, yummy!  Each table had this large plastic container of fresh pickled veggies that you ate while you conversed and nibble on waiting for your meal.  Great chips and salsa too.  Highly recommend this place.More"
