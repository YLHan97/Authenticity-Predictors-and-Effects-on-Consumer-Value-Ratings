But truly one mistake from the person who took the order ruined our experience, as by mistake he punched Broccoli instead of chicken Breast. And the flavor of broccoli was so prominent that it over powered the taste of other two types of chicken. For records, we had ordered one of their ""create your own pizza"" with all our favorite types of chicken. 50% of the pizza amount was waived off from our bill amount after I spoke to the manager. But nothing is justified for the ruined experience as we had walked for almost 25 minutes and then there was a waiting for 5 minutes plus the pizza took 45 minutes to be baked.  The true Giordano experience will have to wait until we plan to travel to US again.",Mukta Mehta,4045281,43477402,DINING

This place was so good we stopped in a second night before we left town! I have never had deep dish pizza before and what better place to have it than in Chicago?! This place was recommended to us by friends. It's all about the pizza here.  It takes time to cook a deep dish pizza here, so you place your order before you get seated.  A 20 minute wait is no problem here, since they will still be cooking your pizza and they have a nice bar off to the side.¬† ¬†We had a deep dish veggie pizza that was excellent! The pizza was like a pie/lasagna. It was stuffed full of the ingredients with some herbs. I would have liked a little more spice but I was able to add chilli flakes and hot sauce to give it that extra zing that I like in a sauce. The service was excellent and the atmosphere was warm and friendly. It's great for families and larger groups of people.

Giordano's,https://www.zomato.com/chicago/giordanos-pizza-south-loop/reviews,"Jul 28, 2016",2.5,"My husband and I went to this Giordano's last night before a soccer game at Soldier Field. We've both been to Giordano's before, so we knew the pizza would be great and we knew the restaurant would be busy.  We got there around 5:15. We didn't have to wait for a table, but it was clear things were hectic. The hosts/hostesses looked frazzled, and the servers were rushing around.  The tables in this restaurant are really packed in. There is only room for one person to walk between tables, so this kinds of adds to the stressed atmosphere as you see servers rushing around with food and drinks trying to navigate between furniture and customers and each other.   We sat for 20 minutes before anyone came to take our drink order. We had seen our waitress rushing around that whole time, not knowing she was our waitress yet. She was definitely not slacking. I noticed the servers don't carry anything on trays there (maybe because there's not enough room to carry trays), so just trying to refill the drinks of the large party next to us took her 3 or 4 trips. I felt a little bad for her.   So after she took our drink and food order, she brought us our water another 10 minutes later (30 minutes seated without a drink), and she didn't come back until 3o minutes later when she dropped off our pizza. She didn't say anything when she dropped it off. Just set it down and left. She didn't come back again until we were done. No drink refills, didn't check on us, nothing. But we could still obviously see how busy she was.   This was not just us, by the way. A party of 6 seated near us was there for a very long time (at least 3o minutes, and I think longer) before she brought them their drinks. We saw another server go to the host station and ask if a certain number table belonged to her. They confirmed that it did, and we heard her say ""Sh**!"" and rush off toward them. Who knows how long they were sitting without service.   After our waitress brought us our check, we put in our credit card right away, but it took her at least 15 minutes to come back and get it, and then we waited several more minutes before she brought it back. She just kind of said to have a nice night.   So....The server wasn't rude, but just overstretched and largely absent.   The worse part was that we were sitting close to the host station, and that was absolutely obnoxious. It started to get really crowded, and there isn't enough room for people to wait, so it felt like there were a lot of people standing very close to us and talking loudly while we were eating. I guess that's just part of the atmosphere, but it's kind of disconcerting.   And for the love of all that is good, this place needs to get some buzzers for people who are waiting for tables. It was really loud in the waiting area, and the hostess was SCREECHING names every 30 seconds. ""John, party of 2? JOHN, party of 2? JOHN?!!?! JOHN?!!!!! JOHN, PARTY OF 2!!!!!!!!!"" (Not the best soundtrack to eat dinner by.)  So, I get it. It's Giordano's. It's a Chicago landmark and a tourist favorite. We were right by Soldier Field and there was a game on. But you would think the management would know what it's like to be slammed and adapt, and have more servers working. ",Liz Overberg,30908925,27773172,DINING

We took the bus to Portillos. We were going to split a couple of hot dogs and Italian beef. We ended up (with several orders) of 4 hot dogs, 3 Italian beef, cheese fries, custard, tamales and chocolate cake. The hot dogs were unbelievable. I never thought a Chicago dog would be that good. The beef sandwiches were super. We got them all dipped so they were messy. Tamale was good although I think I was already past full when I ate it. It had a dark rich sauce that made this one of the best tamales I have had. Custard was cool and creamy. The atmosphere is cool. There is lots of nostalgia everywhere. I cannot say enough about the hot dog. You cannot separate the ingredients- Vienna all beef frank, tomato, onion, sport pepper, mustard, relish, sour pickle and celery salt, and think this would taste like this. The Italian beef was thin cut and is the most beef you would expect on a 7-8 inch Italian roll for less than $6. I saw an article about the chocolate cake so we had to try that too.

They serve their family homemade Polish and Italian food and inspire a restaurant specializing in pierogies and pizza. Flo and Santos in the South Loop is a restaurant with a fun concept, great food and reasonable prices. Charles and I decided to be low key and celebrate Valentine‚Äôs Day a little early with wings, beer and pizza. (That is romantic, right?) Did you know Valentines Day is the second busiest day for restaurants? Mothers Day is the busiest. In an attempt to avoid restaurant craziness tomorrow, we went out to dinner last night, and I will cook dinner for us tomorrow. Charles thought it would be fun to go to dinner and a movie. Ever since we discovered VIP movie tickets with reserved seating (and a bar) at the Showplace Icon we haven‚Äôt gone anywhere else ‚Äì which meant heading out of River North to the South Loop. It was up to me to pick a restaurant. I thought a restaurant that was inspired by a Chicago couple was fitting. Flo (short for Florence) and Santo were the restaurant owner‚Äôs neighbors when he was a child. The bottom of the menu, pictured below, tells a little of the story of Florence and Santo. I love the laid back neighborhood feel of the space. When we first walked in I though it was a small narrow space, but most of the room is in the back. The brick walls are decorated with old photos of Chicago. There are enough tvs to watch a game, but not so many that it‚Äôs obnoxious. There are two bars, one in the front and one in the back. The patrons were a mix of families, groups of friends, a few couples, and a group of cops. (I have this theory that cops always know where to get a great cheap meal. When I was in Italy I would always ask the police for restaurant recommendations ‚Äì they took this very seriously often discussing it with amongst themselves before giving a suggestion). Charles and I decided to eat at the back bar. The beer selection is extensive and focused mostly on local brews, but they still had my favorite, Allagash White. The menu has lots of variety. Appetizers include wings, pork wings (something they invented), pierogies and bruschetta. There are also a couple appetizer sampler platters available. We had the wings which I thought were great ‚Äì meaty and just the right amount of spice. The last time we dined at Flo and Santos we had the pierogies and they were some of the best I have tried. (Did you know that Chicago has the second largest Polish population of any city in the world? Only Warsaw has more Polish people). The entrees include crispy thin crust pizza, along with Polish and Italian classics like Polish sausage and Italian beef. We chose a pizza that was a daily special and was topped with fresh tomatoes, mozzarella, garlic, basil, and a drizzle of balsamic vinegar reduction sauce. I added artichokes to my half since they are my favorite pizza topping. The pizza was cooked to perfection, with the cheese golden brown. The balsamic sauce was sweet and tangy and went very well with the other ingredients. We ordered a large, and were unable to finish it ‚Äì but we came close. The first time Charles and I went to Flo and Santos we went with a group of 4 friends. The thing about Flo and Santos is that you should take advantage of the variety of the menu. The experience is better when you can order wings, pork wings, pierogies, polish sausage, and pizza and try a bit of everything. We loved the pizza last night, and will definitely be back again. Flo and Santos is a fun place to catch up with friends, and a very convenient place to dine before catching a movie. Flo and Santos is located in Chicago‚Äôs South Loop at 1307 South Wabash Ave. It is a short walk from the Roosevelt Red Line stop. They do not take reservations ‚Äì but we had no trouble getting in on a weeknight.",Kit Graham,27459907,23429795,DINING

The highlight of this meal was that we had a groupon and did not pay full price. My fiance and I went yesterday and it being Valentine's Day we called ahead last week to see if we needed reservations. Erica told us no we did not but when we got there at 6:30 last night, yes you did. ""Luckily"" for us we only had to wait about 5-10 minutes for a table. We ordered our margaritas and guacamole and they brought us the standard chips and salsa. While the margarita's were quite big for the price I'm still trying to find the tequila in mine. The chips, salsa and guac, I will say, were pretty good. We ordered our entree's and about 15 minutes later they brought my full fajita dinner out and then the waitress giggles and says I'm sorry I forgot to push the button on yours (to my fiance) it will be right out....what we learned about 15-20 minutes later was she didnt put his order in at all. So here we sit with my food in front of me and nothing for him. I find it rude to eat when my date has nothing so I didn't touch my food. Naturally when they brought his and we began to eat, mine was already cold. The saving grace in that was it had zero taste so it really wouldn't have mattered if it was warm or not. To make up for the error the waitress offers us a complimentary dessert. Which I thought was nice, however, it took another 20 minutes to get a scoop of vanilla ice cream and hard, tasteless churros (a dessert she recommended to us). We got no refills or offers for refills for our cocktails and we had to practically tackle the bus boy for more water. This restaurant would have gotten zero stars if not for the groupon and the waitresses attempt to make up for the poor service.

I'm visiting Chicago from the Gulf Coast and Thursday night is always Mexican night. La Cantina was one of the few mexican restaurants in the South Loop area where I was staying so I decided to give it a try. What a disappointment.   To start there were only 10 people in the place and it took the waitress 10 minutes to acknowledge me. The chips were thick, hard, burned,. and luke cold and the salsa was snot green. I ordered a frozen lime margarita, a chicken chimichanga with spanish rice and refired beans. The margarita was the only thing worth consuming. It was average but overpriced ($6.95 for a small). The chimichanga had a thick crust and was dark brown. They brought out a steak knife with it and after trying to cut into the chimi with a fork I figured out why they brought the knife. The chicken inside had been grilled and it was very very dry. I could have gotten over the dry chicken if the chimi had any taste at all but it was bland and tasteless. The beans looked and tasted like they came out of a can and the spanish rice had to be Uncle Bens. I am not normally one to write a bad review of anything but... $24 for dinner w/ tip and another $10 for a cab. Way too much to pay for bad food.   Maybe I'm spoiled by the authentic mexican food that we have in the Deep South but I'm used to warm crispy chips, fresh red salsa with a little kick, hot queso cheese dip, a chimichanga with a flaky crush that you can easliy cut with a fork that reveals tender chicken seasoned just right, beans that have actually been refried, and homemade spanish rice.",Hilton,20609486,16101613,DINING

I saw no other kids in the restaurant, but our 3 and 4 year olds were very well treated and catered too with quick gratis food, the waitstaff was really good with them, etc.  For the adults I had the veal parmigiana and it was the biggest piece of that such dish I had ever had. I hate ordering it and getting like some tiny medallions, this was a huge amount of veal. It was all very good. I also had some crispy calamari appetizer which was good.   My wife had stuff shells which were good, though very rich and heavy, which is not really a bad thing, but be warned.   The desert we had, a chocolate lava cake, was also delicious.   On balance, the two things that stood out most, were the veal portion and the service.",Chris Beasley,22974022,16089703,DINING

And, then, you're served a cut of meat that you could buy at Jewel and prepare on your patio grill.

Hey Owners, you've invested in a phenomenal place to dine, servers that are the best ever, sides and breads that are wonderful, and a damn good beverage offering... protect this investment by investing in a cut of meat that is worthy of it's surroundings. And, if you are going to serve a Bordelaise sauce with each meat, make sure the customers know it. Don't put it in the fine print. A good steakhouse serves it's meat au natural with sauce choices optional. Don't try to hide average quality cuts with sauce.

When I saw that I had to snap it up.  We don't usually splurge on high end fine dining but thought this would be a great opportunity to test the waters.    Upon stepping in the door the service is phenomenal.  You're led to your table and you can see there's a brigade of servers floating around making sure your water is never less than half full and meticulously placing new silverware with each course.  Once you're settled the service starts and it is definitely an experience.   The tasting menu had about 10 courses overall.  Each one was presented in a unique way.  If you're looking for big portions you may be disappointed but to be honest I was satisfied by the end.  I could describe everything but I'm sure the menu changes fairly often so here were the highlights.   - Fried oyster coated in granola was something I didn't even know was a thing.  Plus they served it in the shells but those shells were placed in this planter filled with sticks and pebbles.    -The salmon was the most delicate piece of fish I've ever had. I don't even enjoy fish and it was cooked just rare so that it was flaky and amazing.    - Clam chowder that was prepared at the table. The soup was extremely delicate and my wife commented that this was one of the first times she really saw me trying to get every bit of soup onto my spoon.    I could go on but I will say they put a lot of effort into the presentation of each course.  The ascetic of modern fused with nature definitely comes through. You could even tell that the bowls and other serving ware were chosen because it seemed like they were molded with a woodsy pattern.  I'd give acadia a 4.5. ",EuroAtHeart,30869580,24593889,DINING

Pizano's Pizza and Pasta,https://www.zomato.com/chicago/pizanos-pizza-pasta-loop/reviews,"Feb 07, 2011",2,"Windy CIty Pizza Club Visits Pizano's. When it comes to Deep Dish Chicago Pizza, Pizano's isn't what you need to satisfy your palette. Their pizzas are big, they're average tasting, but their service is lacking and the cheese and sauce combined were much too heavy. Most recently, the Windy City Pizza Club met there for their monthly meeting, and to many it was disappointing.  According to the Oprah Winfrey show, Pizano's has the best thin crust pizzas in the city and one of the top in the nation, and while the Deep Dish was just okay, their thin crust wasn't much better as it has a very ""warmed up in a microwave"" taste. After hearing so many great reviews from A-List celebrities, and friends, I came to the conclusion that this pizza was not for me. Their location in the loop was roomy and warm on a snowy and frigid Chicago winter's night, but their presence of service for a group of 15 people was lacking and unacceptable for a place that prides itself of spectacular Chicago pizza.  Pizano's was opened in 1991 Rudy Malnati, Junior and features three locations: State Street, Loop, and Glenview, each with it's own unique look and feel. The loop location where the Pizza Club met was 2 stories with a private room and bar in the roomy basement. If you were a true Chicago pizza fan, you would know the family that owns this establishment. Rudy's father, Rudy, Sr. is the founder of Pizzeria Uno & Due. Rudy Jr.'s, brother is Lou Malnati, founder of Lou Malnati's Pizzeria.  According to the Pizano's website, a good raised bread dough tones the crust. In our experience with the crust, it was extremely hard. They use High-grade canned tomatoes and of mozzarella cheese, topped with a sprinkling of grated Parmesan and oregano to complete the basic pizza. It sounded good, but the biggest issue was that they use too much of each item. The actual wait time for pizza was no longer than 20 minutes, so if you are in a rush and want an average pizza with a lot of history, this is a good place. Anchovies, onions or green pepper are other optional additions.   I did enjoy a tossed salad, which was fairly large and nicely priced. All of the prices that Pizano's offers, are out-of-date and expensive for what the quality, but items are large so you could technically say you are getting your money's worth.  I would possibly go back, but not with a group.",Windy City Pizza Club,21571696,16108252,DINING

Pizano's Pizza and Pasta,https://www.zomato.com/chicago/pizanos-pizza-pasta-loop/reviews,"Mar 28, 2010",4.5,"Pizano's = Good Grub!. Chicago... just when I thought you were totally dominated by the Good Grub's California love, Zachary's Chicago Pizza, you go and pull a stunt like this... AND TOTALLY REDEEM YOURSELF! Finally, we know what the Godfather was talking about when he kept calling everyone paisano... literal translation... that dude freaking loves Pizano's. And why shouldn't they... The Pizano's roots dates back over sixty years, and like a fine wine... she's a-getting better with age. At Pizano's, they definitely have the art of Chicago pizza down cold... with that classic, rich, chunky-yet-smooth tomato-top-layer... the wrap-around, crispy, flakey, I-think-I've-just-figured-out-what-true-love-is, hand-tossed crust... and the best part... the ooey, gooey, cheesy, stuffed-like-a-thanksgiving-turkey, deep-dish filling with the Good Grub's personal favorite... spinach and mushroom battling it out in a pizza royal rumble. I've said it before, and I'll say it again... I don't know what it is about spinach and mushroom, but those toppings... scratch that... this is Chicago style... stuffings... go together with Chicago pizza as one of the all time great food pairings... along side peanut butter and chocolate... french fries and milk shakes... flaming hot Cheetos and Dr. Pepper... and that's just science. Adding to the food, Pizano's definitely has a pretty classy flare to bring to the mix... for sure a great place to bring a grub date. But be warned, because when the server lays down that Pizano's-inspired happiness... and starts to dish out the first piping-hot slices... it's just a natural reaction to start singing love songs and whispering sweet nothings... to the pizza. Luckily we were on no-such grub date and could immediately... and ferociously might we add... devour the now-I-know-why-they-call-it-pizza-pie amazingness. On a side note, what is it about Chicago that makes the pizza so mind-blowing? Sometimes we hear that it's the water... nah. Definitely the mob. Only organized crime could have coordinated such a masterpiece. And man, can Pizano's go to war with any of the great crime families. If this place were a crime family... and we're not saying they are a crime family... please don't hurt us Mr. Pizano... their caporegime would make Sonny Corleone look like Sonny & Cher. Leave the gun... take the deep dish. And if you tell me, ""Oh, I've had Chicago Pizza""... and you follow it up with ""at BJ's""... well, it might as well have been Domino's... and that ain't puffery. Seriously, Grub nation, while writing this post I've checked flights to Chicago not once, not twice, but thrice. Because, when you get down to it... I don't really care what it is that makes their pizza so good ... just as long as Pizano's is around... dishing out that deep dish Grub.",The Good Grub,21182198,16108225,DINING

This was very good.   The mushrooms were next, they were cooked perfectly, like cutting into a steak. The sauce was strong on the vinegar side. Very good.  The pizza was next.... Looked interesting, greasy, still a thick crust for a New Yorker, I got to say I was not a fan. Chicago or NY aside. It was to greasy for me. The taste lacked.

I noticed that one of the reviews mentions a less than attentive staff. We did not experience that at all. Our waiter did rounds at least every 5 minutes, and there were only 3 or so tables occupied. The rest of the staff also checked in on us to ask us if we were enjoying ourselves.   My family of 3 visited this restaurant while on a short trip to Chicago. We were staying down the street, and wanted something that was both quick, and had a deal listed on restaurant.com (we have gift cards for that site). We ordered the chicken chili (definitely recommend) and we ordered the Non-veg Dinner. It came with lots of AMAZING food, and only one thing that was slightly meh. It had two different types of curry, one with cheese and peas, and the other was a chicken tikka. It came with naan and rice. Both of the curries were excellent. I honestly couldn't pick my favorite. The naan was naan, and the rice was rice. Both were as good as could be expected. It was a huge meal for two and we definitely have leftovers. The meh part was the tandoori chicken and lamb. The lamb part was awesome, but the chicken could have used some help. It wasn't bad, but i think it needed a little extra punch of flavor. We also ordered ""galub jamun"" for desert. It's sweet dumplings in saffron syrup. they tasted like a fresh warm donut. It was awesome and even my 2 year old wouldn't keep away from it. Prices are reasonable, especially when you use the restaurant.com gift cards! The staff was friendly and attentive. My two year old had a mini tantrum when we entered, and within seconds they delivered a plate of the chips and a drink for her. I am no beer/wine expert, but i also recommend getting the Newcastle with the dinner. They worked well together.   There are tons of food options around this area, but I'm glad we chose this place.

It serves a small menu consisting of bar food fare that is very reasonably priced and pretty good. Nothing too special stands out, but all of the food was decent, and well worth the prices. Perhaps our favorite item was the tator tots- complete with three dipping sauces, included! Everyday features a special discounted lunch item, on already affordable fare, making it super cheap! I tried the philly cheesteak, the special of the day, and was happy with it. Again, nothing extraordinary, but good. My amigos both got the veggie burger (nice that they have a vegetarian option on such a small bar-food menu), and thought it was very good. One even went as far as to say 'loved it!' The waitress/bartendress/manager(?) was very friendly and was very attentive even though we ate outside, serving our food promptly and with an Irish accent. It should be noted that there was small but decent crowd inside drinking and eating, as this seems to be the type of spot that is frequented by regulars.

We got 8 pieces of freshly fried chicken, the chicken being extremely moist in the middle.  The batter was peppery and deliciously seasoned.  The catfish nugget batter was similar to the chicken batter, which was thick and well breaded.  The fries were okay, but the mild sauce made the fries.

The entire management team argued with me about the pricing and told me with no uncertainty that they have the right to change the price at any time. This may be true, however, is this the appropriate manner to treat your customer? I ordered based on the price listed on the web menu and expected to pay that price. At any rate if I had not been making the purchase for a work event I would have left the food behind. The manager keep rushing me off telling me he was busy and the best he was going to do was give me a 10% discount on his new pricing.
