It's only been in the past 5 yrs that I discovered their seafood selections. The fried calamari is a must-not sure how they get that coating so light but NOT greasy, the king crab legs are some of the best I've had anywhere and what I like is that when the serve them, they are already cut in half-so NO FIGHTING WITH THE SHELLS. On special occasions we get the Zuppe de Pesce. It is a huge and delicious pile of seafood;scallops, clams, mussels, whitefish, crab, lobster in a delicious red sauce and comes with pasta and salad too I think. Anyway, we split it and still have enough left for lunch the next day. Whenever we stray or are out of town and try a seafoos restaurant 9.5 times out of 10 we say ""It's not as good as Calo's"" and it's been that way for years. I've honestly NEVER had a bad meal at this restaurant. From the pasta to the pizza it's all really good."

This should not have happened as many times as it did. Across from us was a good size table of people sitting. I know the restaurant has no control of what people do - but one of the kids - a girl of about 7 kept running from one end of the table to the other and stopping and jumping up and down like a rabbit. This caused the floor to vibrate under our seats all throughout our dinner. Another girl of sitting directly across from us (who was about 16 years old) kept stomping her feet under the table throughout our dinner causing the floor to vibrate even more than the young girl hopping up and down every few minutes. My friend and I did not have a pleasant time eating at all. I was going to say something to the parents - but they looked like the kind of people that didn't seem to care what their kids did in any kind of restaurant as they never once told the young girl to stop running back and forth and jumping up and down.

It's only been in the past 5 yrs that I discovered their seafood selections. The fried calamari is a must-not sure how they get that coating so light but NOT greasy, the king crab legs are some of the best I've had anywhere and what I like is that when the serve them, they are already cut in half-so NO FIGHTING WITH THE SHELLS. On special occasions we get the Zuppe de Pesce. It is a huge and delicious pile of seafood;scallops, clams, mussels, whitefish, crab, lobster in a delicious red sauce and comes with pasta and salad too I think. Anyway, we split it and still have enough left for lunch the next day. Whenever we stray or are out of town and try a seafoos restaurant 9.5 times out of 10 we say ""It's not as good as Calo's"" and it's been that way for years.

The crowd is a bit ""older, if you will...which may explain some of these amazing reviews. Italian food has evolved over the past few decades but Calo seems a bit stuck in the past. Offerings are as ""traditional"" as the come...no one is reinventing the wheel here, which has both good and bad connotations. The menu harkens back to the 70's and 80's...traditional ""New York Italian...heavy on the grease and cheese, light on the flavors. Out of a sense of nostalgia, i ordered the Chicken Parm, while my companion ordered the Shrimp Risotto. The appetizer, Baked Stuffed Clams, came quickly...they were a bit sandy and fairly bland and greasy, haphazardly arranged on a bed of romaine. When the entrees arrived, the portions were huge, but they suffered from the 80's concept of Italian food. The Chicken Parm was as i remembered it from that time period; soggy, greasy and covered with a pound of melted mozzarella, while the pasta side was huge and relatively flavorless. The Shrimp risotto suffered from tough shrimp and mushy rice. Neither entree was horrible, but neither were they anything other than ""typical"". I suppose if you miss the greasy, cheesy Sicilian American food of a bygone era, you may enjoy this spot, as the service is good and the dining room is lovely...it's just not for me."

I don't think there are strangers in a bar in Chicago, just new acquaintances. Once we were seated, we enjoyed friendly, attentive and knowledgeable service. We were craving pasta on this particular evening but started with a cheese appetizer that was beautifully served atop fresh greens and perfectly ""dressed""; fresh bread was served alongside.

What a fabulous surprise... Totally remodeled and very sleek and lovely. We were happy to learn dinner was still being served and we quickly ordered a wonderful Crab Cake (2)appetizer and a grilled octopus delight. We shared a Portobello Gnocchi dish- excellent! Portions were generous enough for a doggy-bag. Service was very good despite the late hour and I do believe we were among the last to leave. We have already planned a return trip."

I have never been to an establishment where the staff sides with staff when the server makes a mistake. So what happened, I took my family to Calo's for a going away dinner tonight 4:30pm dinner reservations. My sister could not join us for dinner, so I ordered a rib dinner to go. I preordered the ribs with the server at the same time we all ordered dinner. After dinner the server brought the check to me and walked away with my Visa card, she was gone a few minutes then came back and asked to see my ID. Not sure why she asked for my ID when she never carded me for my beer. After I paid the bill, we all left the restaurant and walked to the parking lot. I put the food in the back of my car when I realized the server never gave us the rib dinner. I went back to the restaurant and told the hostess about my missing rib dinner and she called the server over to ask about the ribs. I asked the server what happened to the rib order and she said, ""well, I didn't charge you for ribs"". I said that charging me for the ribs was not the issue. I ordered ribs and she failed to give me the order. I also tipped this server 20+ % and for what? Another, employee standing at the front desk sided with the server making excuses for why the server forgot the to-go order. She scolded me like a child and said, ""everyone makes mistakes; I should not put the server down"" I have a right to be upset with my order and I never put the server down. The server dropped the ball during a time restaurant was not slammed. The other staff member at the front desk wouldn't stop with the scolding. She went on and on about how she was going to give me the ribs for free; I should get over it. I never asked for anything for free. I decided not to say anything else to this staff member. I expect good service from Calo since this is considered a better quality eating establishment. Tonight, I have learned that the customer experience at Calo's comes last and their employees come first. I won't stop going to Calo's because I love the food, but I won't forget the experience."

The portion sizes were ample, and had we not been staying at a hotel, there would've been left-overs for sure. The only fly in the ointment was the over zealous busboy who CONSTANTLY reached between us to clear dishes from the table that he could've taken away from the other side of the table without intruding on our personal space. And they had us re-use our utensils and the way we found that out was the same busboy took our silver ware off our finished first course and plunked them summarily on the unclothed table; ""plunk"".

(Andersonville did not exist as a trendy destination). There was even an improbable couple playing an electric piano and ""singing"" a la Captain and Tennille. Fast forward to re-decoration, a review in a local PBS show, and a HUGE improvement in the food. It's now one of our neighborhood choices. Our last visit was for a birthday Their mussels in cream wine sauce could pass for Belgian: plump, delicate, exquisite. Friends had calamari fritti, a chicken Marsala, farfalle Molese and lemon chicken. They were all traditionally well-made, yet with a lighter touch. I don't understand the disparaging comments made elsewhere about the bread--I make my own focaccia, and theirs made mine seemed inadequate. They brought a tiramisù with candles for the birthday boy, a nice touch. The portions are traditional Italian LARGE-- plenty of leftovers. For a Sunday night the room was quite busy and loud. Our server was lovely, knowledgeable. and a genuinely personable. Kudos to her!"

We should have left when the bread arrived. A basket of cheap white ""French"" bread, like you would get for 99 cents at Jewel, and 2 limp pieces of foccacia, were served with some sort of whipped butter that wouldn't melt. A good, toothsome, artisinal bread is the hallmark of any good Italian restaurant. The salad, iceberg, cucumber cherry tomato, was very cold and fresh. Then my steak came. At a moderately priced $32, it was a decent sized (10 oz) filet and perfectly cooked to medium rare. Unfortunately, it had been marinated in some sort of garlic flavored broth that gave it a peculiar and fake flavor. Who marinates filet? Restaurants that serve ungraded filets; that's who. Although it was properly cooked, this cut had none of the telling, buttery, melt in your mouth flavor that a Prime filet would have.The 'garlic' mashed potatoes also tasted like garlic flavoring. There was nothing wrong with this meal; it just wasn't anything to make me go back."

The hostess said people at the table were just sitting there and not leaving. This happens - but there are several polite ways to handle this. Instead they told us our table was ready and proceeded to try and seat us in the bar. When we said no-We had made a reservation, it was a special occasion and we would like to be in the restaurant both hostesses were very icy toward us and we had to speak to the manger to be seated.

The waitress came to take our order, but didn't tell us about or explain any of the specials. There was one printed page on the table of the specials. Drinks arrived fairly quickly and water glasses were refilled before they were half empty. The salad was very good with the house dressing. The meals were excellent. Good variety of menu items from traditional to things you don't commonly find elsewhere. All 6 dishes were rated very good. Portions were large with leftovers to take home. Sat for a long time talking after dinner and didn't feel rushed. Would definitely recommend especially for visitors like us who were looking for a very good meal at a reasonable price."

We were quite impressed with the joint as a place with good food at a solid value. A few years later, we once again visited with our two oldest children, and once again had an enjoyable time at a price point that was acceptable.Fast forward 10+ years, and our trip to Chicago this time to take in the Harry Potter exhibition at the MSI. Prior to leaving Mpls we raved about this restaurant and forwarded the menu link to our friend, who were joining us. Upon review, they were nearly as excited as we were! Our party which included our youngest, now 13, and friends of the family with their 13 year old.. Upon arrival, we were greeted quickly and warmly and were seated within minutes.Unfortunately, the good feelings pretty much came to a crashing halt at that point. Our server, Anca (sp?) unfortunately wasn't nearly as warm as our greeter, nor was she terriblly efficient. A sticker shock came as we compared the menu to what was listed online, prices were $4-$8 higher across the board.Fortunately, the food was defintely good, so in that regard they haven't slipped, but at their new menu prices it certainly couldn't be considered a ""value"". Also, with the new (to us) remodel, it certainly was noisier than I remember, to the point that it was very dififcult to carry on a conversation.Overall, I don't think I can honestly recommend this restaurant any longer and it will fade into our memories as ""remember that place..."""

We aren't of Irish descent and we don't drink alcoholic beverages. But I've read so much about the friendly and jovial atmosphere at Irish pubs--maybe I've been watching too much British TV--that I thought it would be a fun adventure to see if Irish pubs are as enjoyable as advertised. They are. Take Lady Gregory's Bar & Restaurant, for example. Located at 5260 North Clark Street, it is rated among the top five Irish pubs in Chicago. Irish pubs usually aren't described as upscale but Lady Gregory's is a traditional Irish pub with a flair of elegance and pizzazz. It offers farm-to-table bar bites and a large beer and whiskey menu. The food is downright delicious. Have you had an Ultimate Grilled Cheese Sandwich with bacon, Gruyere, white cheddar, mozzarella, brie, roasted tomato and fried shallots on parmesan crusted sourdough bread? That's just a hint of what's on the menu at Lady Gregory's. We started with deviled eggs and tomato basil soup. My wife chose meatloaf with all-natural Meyers Angus beef and Iowa pork with mashed potatoes, gravy, crispy onions and tomato chutney. I couldn't resist the country chicken pot pie with chicken, onions, carrots, celery, potatoes, peas and chicken cream gravy in a pastry crust. I crave chicken pot pie and Lady Gregory's version is as good as it gets. All of which means we had to pass up grilled salmon, fish and chips, shepherd's pie, rosemary roasted garlic chicken and halibut with parmesan egg crust. And the Ultimate Grilled Cheese Sandwich. Next time. Who said the only good thing you can count on at an Irish pub is a pint of Guinness?"

When crowded with people the noise level can get loud, but it's a fun experience.The menu is creative, and everything we ordered was delicious from their Chicken Pot Pie to their Broken Promise Burger. When the weather cooperates there is also outdoor dining. We will definitely return."

Fish Great, Rest Downhill.","This is a popular spot among the Bar and Grilles in Andersonville. Nice atmosphere and not as noisy as the other spots so my expectations were high. We ordered Fish and Chips and their signature burger. The fish was quite good but the chips were awful. The burger itself was nothing special loaded with ingredients that were mostly unidentifiable. Trying a little too hard on the burger in an attempt to make it different I think. Nothing that a robust grilled burger with a reasonable amount of garnishing couldn't fix. Back to the chips which are their regular french fries. Come on guys, how hard it is the serve a crisp order of fries. Finally the service started out OK but it also deteriorated quickly. We actually had to flag a different server to order desert after not seeing ours for quite a while. Apparently he was "" going to be our server"" for a little while, not the whole time.There is no reason this can't be a nice spot with a little effort from the wait staff and the chef but for us it failed to meet expectations."

We like to be seated in the “library” which is in the back and quieter, as it can get noisy here during busy times. Had a lovely waitress who was very patient with us as we had some special needs. The gluten-free brussels sprouts were terrific as was the artichoke dip. You’d never know these were gluten-free. Great salads and burgers and my husband loves the chicken pot pie. We had the flourless chocolate cake and that was terrific. The only disappointed patron was me. It was my birthday and I decided to treat myself to a Ruben and fries. The menu mentioned maple syrup and I should have paid attention to that. It was a sickeningly sweet sandwich which I just could not stomach. Should have asked for a return item, but we were pressed for time. Heated up today it was even worse, so I had to dispose of it. Very atypical Ruben and I don’t suggest ordering it. Otherwise, I’d give this five stars. Check this place out when in Andersonville. Recommended. Just steer clear of the Ruben."

The first time was for brunch. I had one of the best, fluffiest omelets I have ever had. I didn't know anything about this place and thinking that it was an Irish pub, maybe the omelets would be okay, but it was absolutely delicious. I can't wait to go back for brunch again.The second time we went was for dinner. Excellent beer and whisky list. Bartenders are very friendly and were quick to give a sample of something if we questioned the taste of a beer, cider, etc. The dinner we ordered was delicious! We started off with the curry fries app. Yummy. Served the traditional way with the sauce poured over the fries. For dinner my husband had the meatloaf. Classic comfort food. A big slab over mashed potatoes. I try to eat less meat so I ordered the veggie burger. I kid you not, I took a bite and called the bartender over to tell her they made a mistake and I had been given a meat patty. It wasn't, it was a veggie patty. I was completely blown away that the veggie burger tasted so much like meat. She gave me a tip when I ordered it - order the regular burger with a veggie patty. This way you get regular cheese and the bun is not ""vegan"" (I don't care about the cheese or bun). This was an excellent suggestion and I highly recommend the veggie burger ordered this way.They heard we were new to the area and sent us over a sticky toffee pudding at the end of the meal. So kind and welcoming. We look forward to becoming regulars at Lady Gregory's since we now live in the neighborhood. Great place!"

The hostess advised us that most of the wait is really for the outdoor tables. I'm not keen on eating outside so we got a table right near the window, but since it was nice weather we got both the fresh air and an indoor table.

The restaurant reopened as LG's. One can only assume the effort was an attempt to erase their previous reputation and start up a new one. Well it didn't work. The food is mediocre and the service is inattentive. I had to get up from my table to find our server Angela, and ask her if we could order. Needless to say she was chatting in a corner. Later I had to ask a different server to give us a second round on our wine glasses which had sat empty for ten minutes without Angela ever stopping by. Add to that a lack of smiles and sincerity and you get the picture. At one point I approached the host and asked to see a manager. He said he would send one over. Then the same host came to our table alone and said, ""The manager would like to know what it is regarding."" A manager who screens his/her interaction with customers? I said, ""Forget it."" And while you're at it, forget LG's. If you want a more interesting menu and more attentive service just go next door to the VIG or across the street to other choices.

We then had a portabello mushroom wrap (me) with the edamame and corn salad (both great), while my wife had a bowl of the bean soup (which was delicious).

The atmosphere in the bar/restaurant is very conducive to conversation and kicking back. There's a genuine hospitality upon entering that is matched by the warmth of a fire and decorative lighting. The food choices may be somewhat limited but everything we tried was delectable. The beer selection is extensive - and best of all, perhaps, is the service. What upbeat, friendly staff!

We had never been there before, but had heard good things about it. The atmosphere was really cozy, and the place is centered around a really beautiful wooden bar, that just seems to radiate ""Welcome - real and sit down"".We ate a booth right by the bar, and I was a little apprehensive - thinking it was much more a bar than a restaurant, so how good could the food be. Answer - the food was great! We started with the deviled eggs, which were flavored with a wonderful hint of spice Thai pepper oil, and topped with a garlic crisp. Yummy! We then had a portabello mushroom wrap (me) with the edamame and corn salad (both great), while my wife had a bowl of the bean soup (which was delicious). The food was fresh and filled with wonderful flavors.The service was really friendly and welcoming, but was at times pretty slow. It seemed a bit surprising since the restaurant wasn't too full at all when we got there (early - just before lunch time). For some reason it just seemed a little short staffed with the same couple of people working hard to cover everything. They were all gracious and friendly - just a little backed up.Overall a great lunch and I would go back anytime!"

We had to wait a total of 31 minutes for our table. We were lucky and got a booth that was relatively quiet. Two of us started with the Tomato Basil Soup. The soup was fantastic, creamy and rich the way it should be. It could be a meal by itself. Then all four of us got the Grilled Cheese Sandwich. It was absolutely the Best Grilled Cheese Sandwich ever. The blend of cheeses with the candied bacon and shallots was unbelievably good. The sandwich was so big three out of four of us could not finish it, and took it home. The sides were good also from the wild rice to the sweet potato fries.The waiter was very good, even though it too a while to get the food.

I go for the ham, nice thick piece of toast with home made strawberry jam and pick of a side. Can't go wrong with Irish grits, but potatoes are great as well. Benedict dishes are good as well as their breakfast burrito, though half of that went home with me. Best recommendation I've found is to share the side version of the biscuits and gravy with a friend and both eat half, their gravy is loaded with flavor but rich, I could only eat half of one. I want to know who can eat a full order by themselves :)"

If you have a mac and cheese craving, it can be satisfied here. The chicken club is made with an actual grilled chicken breast - not sliced deli-style chicken. Sweet potato fries are yummy and come with maple syrup (ketchup provided if you ask). Excellent roasted vegetables and turkey burgers, too.

(kee-no-ah, by the way), but we wanted a lighter meal. I understand that MY neighborhood bar is known for potent drinks, but I asked my friends if could detect any scotch in my drink.

The choices we made proved wise ones. The chicken pot pie brimmed with chicken and vegetables under a flaky cover. The crispy onions sprinkled atop the meat loaf not only added texture, but a delightful burst of flavor. Also well received were the goat cheese, roasted tomato and basil flatbread, the macaroni and cheese (with bacon), and the baby carrots in the whiskey glaze. The Bombay kale stir fry was a winner.Our server was patient and listened well.

Our grandson can not have dairy and there were many items on the menu that took care of his needs as well. The service was prompt and the restaurant was very casually elegant. We'll make sure to dine there again when we're back in Chicago.

We walked out satisfied. Located in eclectic Andersonville, Lady Gregory's fits the neighborhood well. It has a pub atmosphere and can astound customers with a full, leather-bound beer menu.The food menu is extensive and varied. It can take you from the expected -- meat loaf, reuben, burgers, chicken pot pie -- to the out-of-the-ordinary (roasted cauliflower steak, cavalo nero soup, Bombay kale & chickpea stir fry and Oscar's Buddha bowl). The choices we made proved wise ones. The chicken pot pie brimmed with chicken and vegetables under a flaky cover. The crispy onions sprinkled atop the meat loaf not only added texture, but a delightful burst of flavor. Also well received were the goat cheese, roasted tomato and basil flatbread, the macaroni and cheese (with bacon), and the baby carrots in the whiskey glaze. The Bombay kale stir fry was a winner.Our server was patient and listened well. The wait for our food was more than reasonable and the dining area provided enough noise reduction that conversation was easy to have. The prices were not unreasonable. The child in our group was welcomed and decided from several selections on a kids' menu.Overall, Lady Gregory's provided an amicable and pleasing experience."

It was rich with salmon and scrod, and probably the best seafood chowder that we have ever had, including chowders in Boston, California, and the NJ shore. From the regular menu we also ordered a chicken wing appetizer, bean soup, and mushy peas which were all prepared very well.Wes was particularly helpful.

Our server/bartender, Rachel, was very attentive to us, though she was definitely busy. We picked the ultimate grilled cheese sandwich and the gastro burger. The grilled cheese consisted of gruyere, aged cheddar, mozzarella, brie, roasted tomato concassé, fried shallots, candied bacon confetti melted in parmesan-crusted sourdough. The parmesan crust on the sourdough really added to the sandwich. The gastro burger was huge (tall), with two patties. I ordered the burgers medium rare and they were juicy. Both the grilled cheese and the burger were very tasty, and we also had a side of mac and cheese which was also very tasty. If you live in the neighborhood, this is a great place to walk to and visit, but street parking can be tough. It would be great to go back at a time when it is not so busy."

The price was a little high though. We then got the lobster mac and cheese and it was soooooo good. Creamy and very tasteful. It had a good amount of lobster. We also got the steakhouse salad and the meat was cooked just how I wanted it, Med Rare. The salad was light and not soaked in dressing as some other salads can be. The sweet potato fries with maple dressing were the perfect balance of sweet and salty. Finally, for dessert we got the Reese's cookie with vanilla ice cream. It was a little dry but good.

Phew! They have a sizeable bottled beer list, but I went with red wine instead.The standouts were the brussels sprouts (simple but delicious), the beets (same thing), and the flatbread. The flatbread was pretty sparse in terms of ingredients, but each ingredient was so delicious that I loved the overall effect. Just wish they'd been more liberal wtih the toppings! The lemon chili olives were abundant, but really too salty for me. Yes, I know olives are salty, but these seemed especially so. We couldn't finish them between us even though I wasn't exactly stuffed, I just stopped wanting such a salty snack.Food is above average but not re-inventing the wheel and I think they could do more to spice it up.

Not surprisingly, the place was packed inside and out and we were asked to wait for a table at the bar. The bar turned out to be a pleasant and comfortable place to sit for our meal so we stayed there.This place has a real neighborhood vibe with an interesting menu and great selection of beer and wine by the bottle and glass. The grilled caesar salad and roasted brussel sprouts were excellent!Service from our server, Fidelma, was notably prompt, attentive and friendly for being seated at the bar. Fidelma's infectious smile and cheeriness set the tone for our entire visit!We would return without hesitation. Highly recommended."

My mom and my friend and I were seated at a big table right in front of a fireplace in the back room. I can't really imagine a better start to a chilly evening - who doesn't love a bar with a fireplace?? The backroom is cozy and lined with bookshelves; the atmosphere certainly invites lingering.We shared a bunch of small plates - deviled eggs, lemon chili olives, pan-roasted brussels sprouts, warm-roasted beets, and the fig jam - prosciutto - blue cheese flatbread. Phew! They have a sizeable bottled beer list, but I went with red wine instead.The standouts were the brussels sprouts (simple but delicious), the beets (same thing), and the flatbread. The flatbread was pretty sparse in terms of ingredients, but each ingredient was so delicious that I loved the overall effect. Just wish they'd been more liberal wtih the toppings! The lemon chili olives were abundant, but really too salty for me. Yes, I know olives are salty, but these seemed especially so. We couldn't finish them between us even though I wasn't exactly stuffed, I just stopped wanting such a salty snack.Food is above average but not re-inventing the wheel and I think they could do more to spice it up. It's the atmosphere where this place really shines. We had the most amazing colored glass paneling on the ceiling above our table too! I'd come back here anytime for a drink and a few little snacks but I think for dinner you'd be better served elsewhere."

Even though the restaurant was busy, she took time to describe the menu and make very good recommendations. Service was prompt.The whiskey list is one of the finest and most extensive I have come across ... Diverse selections that included some hard to find (Black Maple Hill for example). From Whiskeys to scotches and everything in-between.... Well worth going just for this list.Are group raved about all their individual choices, food is fresh; one of the specials on our evening was sold out, which tells me not only its popular, they cook FRESH daily and when its out, its out, something positive in my book. Prices are a great value, not expensive for quality food/service.Can be a bit noisy, if your party is large enough, they have a great closed off area in the back - look for it and if you can get it - that is a real score....Highly recommend in you are traveling near or through Andersonville ..."

It wasn't. The atmosphere is a great Irish pub sort of theme, and has a very authentic feel, as opposed to places that try but don't quite get there. The waiter was great, with lots of helpful suggestions. Two of us had (angus) burgers, one Heart of Palm Salad, and one Grilled Cheese w/ Tomato soup. Everything was delish, and clearly homemade. The Grilled Cheese was wonderful, 3 (or 4?) different cheeses. Definitely get the 1/2 sandwich combo with soup, otherwise it would be death by cheese. The burgers were fantastic. The salad was great as well, large with very fresh ingredients."

They have a good drink menu, nice choices of beers and even some very good non-alcoholic specialty drinks (a rarity and I hope they continue this!

The positives are the drink menu, better than average food, and a nice atmosphere for a group outing. I do not think that Lady Gregory's is a fantastic place for a date night because it is rather loud inside. Recommendations: Try their turkey burger... I know, I know... most restaurants give you a dried out piece of meat, but they grind their own turkey meat and add wonderful seasoning. Truly one of the best turkey burgers I have ever had. Also, try their mashed peas for something a little different. If you like peas, you will LOVE these. And of course, try some of their amazing beers, huge selection to choose from.

The menu includes such delicious items as fried chicken, shrimp and grits, catfish and grits, chicken and dumplings, curry peanut bisque, chestnut spaghetti, gumbo, skillet cornbread, buttermilk biscuits, Louisiana crawfish pie and Caroline shrimp burger and barbecued pork shoulder sandwiches.

The result was basically chicken soup with a few small extremely thin slices of chicken meat (like 1/8 inch thickness), and very few morsels of vegetables, and about three ""dumplings"" which quite frankly were so hard that I had trouble cutting through them with my knife. In any household that I know of if grandma said that she was going to cook up a meal like this for the family everyone would be shouting ""Oh let's just go out for dinner Grandma"".To be fair, the taste of the food was fine. But the overall product was simply very strange.Additionally I was in the mood for a side of bread, so I ask about their cornbread and their biscuits since I love both of those usually. The waiter highly recommended the biscuits. They came out and were wildly over baked, with a hard crust that more resembled a hard roll. Attempted to salvage it, ready to smear on some butter and what their menu described as ""fruit preserves"", thinking that always is a good thing. The ""fruit preserves"" were about 6 blue berries that had been boiled in their juices. Honestly, and sadly, it was like spooning a stewed prune onto the biscuit. Not horrible, but still totally NOT what a real biscuit and preserves should be like, not even close.Also, our table thought that the service was extremely so. And now that I'm reading a few others reviews here, it appears our experience may be the norm. And you can't blame it on the kitchen needing 45 minutes to meticulously preparing each dish. Things like chicken/dumplings or grits are typically something that is more on the ready back on the stove.I do try to be very fair on my reviews, so I will summarize in saying this food tasted ok but do not come here if you're looking for Southern Cooking that will make you feel at home or comfy."

Made a reservation because we thought it would be busier but we didn't need it as the restaurant was maybe 60% full. I was surprised given the neighborhood, the fact that it was a beautiful sunny day, and all the good reviews I'd read.The food was very good (the beignets were delicious and quite large) and the server was nice but the whole experience was very rushed. Felt as though they were pushing out to food to flip tables even though they never really got busy. The prices are a little steep, especially the cocktails, even when you consider the local area. Worth dropping in if you're in the area but I wouldn't go out of my way to go back."

Once we sat, a female server took care of us. It started with ordering drinks. We order 2 Mimosa and she offer a bottle and said it was a better deal, so that is what we ordered. Waited 15 minutes until she told us the bottle of bubbly we order was warm. She offered an upsell. Which always makes me crazy. I asked for her to offer same price she said she would check. Finally when she came back they where out of that one. So, she brought Prosecco and we were fine w/that and brought one glass of OJ. What's really good! Grits w/mushrooms, Omelet Tasso, Fried Chix/Biscuts. But, they are all full of beading and not worth $14, good though. Not good! Binet's, to large and not enough powder sugar and the Puff muffins no taste in them or the butter.We had to ask for everything. Servers assistance where saving her for the were great and friendly. One more thing! $8 for 2 glasses of OJ! Thank you for the better deal, Not!I will try again for I think the food had potential. Just hope to have a better friendlier server and a Bad Server will kill any good meal."

If you are a tourist, particularly a foodie tourist this should be on your top 5 list. I have been here several times over the years and most recently went for an early dinner.I had forgotten how good a cook the chef is and how he meticulously sources all his plates from the history of cooking in the south. First off his food just is good. He sources from local farmers in the Chicago area and authentic organic growers in the South. This is another restaurant that if it were closer to me I would be in all the time. I tried one of their slushies which is delicious and of course has a slew of ingredients that take time to prepare. If you are visiting Chicago particularly from another country you should try this place because it gives you a great example of a style and type of cooking that is very representative of a slice of America. Sometimes the higher end restaurants all kind of mix together, their plates are all pretty, they use great ingredients but it is not representative necessarily of a place. Big Jones is as others have said is unique but at the same time you will like the food.It is located in Andersonville which is a hike from downtown Chicago, there are buses and a taxi from the MagMile will probably take you 20 minutes and be around $15. When I visit other countries I sometimes hesitate to go to a neighborhood I don't know and is out of my way. But in this case it is definitely worth it, you will not be disappointed. But I stress, it is not big relative to say the restaurants on West Randolph street so make a reservation."

A third had the evening special of chicken and dumplings which he assured us tasted even better than it smelled. We foolishly decided to share two desserts--foolish, because the one sweet potato chocolate pot de creme would have been enough for all four of us after what we had already eaten. Prices are midrange. The service was not speedy, but it was friendly and accommodating (and the restaurant was full). The ginger tea was the only disappointment--not much ginger flavor."

If you're into crawfish or catfish or cornbread or Cajun or Creole or gumbo or shrimp and grits or smoked pork shoulder, you'll find it here. But Big Jones has made its reputation on fried chicken, which is fried in leaf lard, ham drippings and clarified butter and served with sweet potato hash and voodoo greens. Start with skillet cornbread, which is baked in cast iron with bacon fat and green onions and served with Ellis Farms honey and whipped butter. Or crawfish and cheese hushpuppies. Or something really unique, Sally Lunn, a staple of southern cooking for centuries, a soft rich butter and egg bread served with honey butter and home-made preserves. Or pimento cheese or split pea soup or fried green tomatoes or gumbo. If you prefer something other than fried chicken for your entree, Big Jones offers some delicious options, including a Carolina shrimp burger, a Peacemaker Po'Boy (crispy oysters on crusty bread with remoulade, cabbage and bread and butter pickles with Creole-spiced potato chips), catfish, crawfish and hand-cut noodles and seafood.

If you're into crawfish or catfish or cornbread or Cajun or Creole or gumbo or shrimp and grits or smoked pork shoulder, you'll find it here. But Big Jones has made its reputation on fried chicken, which is fried in leaf lard, ham drippings and clarified butter and served with sweet potato hash and voodoo greens. Start with skillet cornbread, which is baked in cast iron with bacon fat and green onions and served with Ellis Farms honey and whipped butter. Or crawfish and cheese hushpuppies. Or something really unique, Sally Lunn, a staple of southern cooking for centuries, a soft rich butter and egg bread served with honey butter and home-made preserves. Or pimento cheese or split pea soup or fried green tomatoes or gumbo. If you prefer something other than fried chicken for your entree, Big Jones offers some delicious options, including a Carolina shrimp burger, a Peacemaker Po'Boy (crispy oysters on crusty bread with remoulade, cabbage and bread and butter pickles with Creole-spiced potato chips), catfish, crawfish and hand-cut noodles and seafood. In a town that is famous for steaks and hot dogs and pizza, Big Jones offers a delicious change of pace."

Basically they kicked me out. I had two main dishes and a coffee and left a good tip just because the waiter was nice. However, it made no sense that the couple next to me had been having coffee and talking for the past hour like me and I got kicked out just because I was eating by myself? That's rude and honestly, pissed me off. If this is the way they treat new customers... I don't recommend this. "

Even though the place was packed and people were waiting to get a table, we didn't feel rushed.Some of the food highlights ...Mushroom and grits - a very savory twist on grits. A rice based waffle served with potted duck, preserved peaches, berries and a side of whisky sauce. This dish offered a great juxtaposition of flavors. The savory flavors of the duck both complemented and contrasted nicely with the sweet fruit and the creamy whisky sauce. Overall it was a well balanced dish.Buckwheat banana pancakes - strong buckwheat flavor. If you're not a fan of buckwheat I'd avoid this dish. Alternatively if you're looking for an interesting version of pancakes I'd recommend it. The pancakes are big and heavy with lots of flavor. The toasted nuts on top provide a nice complement to the buckwheat. Perfect for a big appetite.We'll be back - for both dinner and brunch"

Delicious (complimentary) beignets were served almost immediately after the server brought coffee (several options) and tea (TEA DRINKERS NOTE: Several delicious varieties are offered, served in a small cast iron steeping pot).A Turkey Red Wheat Scone was moist and delicious. The crab cakes, part of Eggs New Orleans, were some of the tastiest I've ever had. The eggs were done to perfection. My companion ordered Corn Griddle Cakes and the serving was probably enough food for three people. However, the Corn Cakes were a bit more dark than you'd expect.

The kind that starts you salivating? And then you see it in real life and it's more than disappointing?? Well Big Jones lives up to the glorious TV fried chicken!!! Heads up - the fried chicken requires 30 minutes, and when it arrives, give it a few more minutes before you dig into the most crispy, crunchy, juicy and flavourful chicken you may ever have (otherwise you'll burn your taste buds off). I can't imagine having any better fried chicken. Anywhere. Ever. The chicken was served over succotash (yummy) and sautéed greens (not my cup of tea, although my friend enjoyed them...but not enough to finish off mine). My recommendation for Big Jones is to serve the sides separate from the chicken, since the bottom of the chicken lost its crunchy goodness as it absorbed some of the juices from the greens and succotash. While waiting for our chicken, we ordered the pimento cheese. OMG, where has THIS been all my life? Loved it and the 5 home made crackers that came with it. (Another note to Big Jones, maybe up the crackers, even by 1... 5 was a wee challenge to share between 2). Honestly I could have eaten the appetizer all on my own, but I reluctantly shared with my friend (who was probably thinking the exact same thing). So if you're in Chicago and craving fried chicken, make your way to Big Jones."

We had been for Thanksgiving twice and for brunch once. We went to celebrate our 10th anniversary. Honestly, the details. It's about the details. I could go and just eat pickles and pimento cheese and be perfectly happy. Who pickles fiddle head fern? Big Jones does. And they are delicious. I am not sure what dairy they use, but it is impossible to notice the quality. The cream has fat on the top. The butter is like nothing most of you have had before. Well, unless you have your own cows that you love and care for. I always say I want to meet these creatures. Fried chicken is a big deal here. Fried in lard, ham drippings and clarified butter with a corn meal crust. Yup, it makes noise when you crack it open. The voodoo greens served with the chicken almost had me asking for another order. A little bitter, some little hint of vinegar and perfect texture. Raised in Chicago, there are some unfamiliar ingredients. No matter, the wait staff will answer all your questions and make suggestions if you are indecisive. There is a lot of love and craft put into the food here, and into the cocktails and bar menu, as well as the play list. Oh, yeah. Desserts too. Don't forget those. The night we were there we had the rhubarb pie. The streusel topping made friends with the butter. Something here is going to remind you of your mom or grandmother.

We had Christmas Eve dinner which was a prix fixe; I don't know if this is the norm, or just for the holiday.An inviting small restaurant, with a nice atmosphere. The style is creole, and mostly authentic in my opinion. I lived in New Orleans 8 years and go back often. I was told the restaurant owner is from Indiana (surprise!). Nevertheless, be prepared for really great food.Started with a cocktail. The Sazerac was better than I expected. Not many know how to make this drink. First course was a butternut squash bisque which was perfect on a cold night. Three of us chose this; the fourth, my daughter enjoyed her fried oyster/ham/rice. I forget what it was called. Next, the salad course. My wife had beets. I don't do beets, kind of a joke for my family and friends. She loved it. The rest of us had the butter lettuce which was just a bit salty from the nuts and feta cheese, but nevertheless fresh and tasty. Main course time. 3 of us enjoyed the trout filet stuffed with crawfish, while my independent daughter loved her gumbo with goose as small meatballs. I tried it. Delicious. For dessert there was a cake that had some chocolate, but was very much like a yellow cake with chocolate streaks and a toffee (?) icing, brad pudding, and a cranberry/marrow pie. All were excellent. Be prepared. There are a lot of flavors here and food that is rich and filling. Just what I like, but I know not for everyone. They did serve a home made dark bread with walnuts. I would suggest sticking with French bread, and keep it coming, just to be authentic to the Louisiana theme they are seeking.Very enjoyable meal with my family on Christmas Eve. "

My wife and I still have mallet marks on our foreheads after this morning's brunch at Big Jones.First, construction detours had us running late for our reservation (for Saturday brunch, one of their truly busy times). I called, apologized; The response was a genuinely, ""We'll do what we can."" What they could turned out to be great understanding and the next available 2-top within 5 minutes of our arrival. The host could not have been more welcoming (except , perhaps, for the owner/exec chef who was with him, greeting customers as if they were entering his home as honored guests). This is and incredibly busy shift for one and all; tables turning like crazy, more diners arriving constantly, tables being moved to accommodate two diners, six diners. You would never know that by seeing the performance of the service staff. Serene, smiling, charming hosts, seemingly interested in nothing but the client's happiness. Rushing (but calmly) themselves, but making it clear that diners could take their time, enjoy the experience, and stay, welcomed, until they were finished. (At the height of brunch at one of Chicago's busiest brunch venues? Who does that anymore?)Ok, now the food, Extraordinary understates it. I don't know what wouldn't understate it except for that mallet to the head. My wife had the Big Jones Benedict. We're talking about a Benedict served on popovers -- not just any popovers. Ham that could make you cry. Mine was the shrimp & grits. Yes, you can get shrimp & grits at who knows how many places in Chicago. But you ain't gettin' shrimp & grits like this. Grits that took me back to trips through South Carolina when I was a kid. Perfect shrimp, perfectly cooked. Tasso ham gravy. (Can we get a posthumous Nobel prize for Mr. Tasso?) It all inspired me a thought to bring harmony to the South.There remains debate about giving up the Stars & Bars in several Southern states. Personally, I've got reservations about how much to glory valor, however glorious, in the cause of treason, but that's me. But why not pick instead a glory shared by one and all in the South, replacing the Stars & Bars with a nice bowl of shrimp & grits?"

There were only 7 customers in the restaurant, decorated with prosaic tourism photos of New Orleans and Louisiana. The lighting was outdoor lamps on sconces. I would imagine it could be dark at night.I am not a connoisseur of fried chicken, or its regional subtleties or merits. To me it was fine, not too heavy breading, a tad salty (but I have to disqualify myself on salt issues--I use none) the collards were sour and bitter, and the potatoes I think had made a trip to the freezer. My partner, the connoisseur of chicken said that he could not understand why it was rated so highly. ""Mediocre."" I hadn't had breakfast, so I had ""cajun"" breakfast-- just like in any restaurant except for the Louisiana style boudin. The boudin I know is French. In this one I could not really see much in terms of vegetables nor the distinctive flavor of the French blood sausage. Maybe it was not supposed to be--I know this boudin can be made with any flesh.

Best corn bread since our childhoods. My wife had amazing grouper bouillabaisse with gulf shrimp and oysters. I had the lovely and delicious chicken and dumplings, light and tasty. We ended with rum bread pudding and sorghum ice cream. Corban provided able advice and fine service. Paul explained a few dishes and helped us understand his updating of the older versions of our early meals in the south back in the sixties and seventies. The wine and whiskey lists are also deep and varied. Truly exceptional dining in Andersonville. "

We had Christmas Eve dinner which was a prix fixe; I don't know if this is the norm, or just for the holiday.An inviting small restaurant, with a nice atmosphere. The style is creole, and mostly authentic in my opinion. I lived in New Orleans 8 years and go back often. I was told the restaurant owner is from Indiana (surprise!). Nevertheless, be prepared for really great food.Started with a cocktail. The Sazerac was better than I expected. Not many know how to make this drink. First course was a butternut squash bisque which was perfect on a cold night. Three of us chose this; the fourth, my daughter enjoyed her fried oyster/ham/rice. I forget what it was called. Next, the salad course. My wife had beets. I don't do beets, kind of a joke for my family and friends. She loved it. The rest of us had the butter lettuce which was just a bit salty from the nuts and feta cheese, but nevertheless fresh and tasty. Main course time. 3 of us enjoyed the trout filet stuffed with crawfish, while my independent daughter loved her gumbo with goose as small meatballs. I tried it. Delicious. For dessert there was a cake that had some chocolate, but was very much like a yellow cake with chocolate streaks and a toffee (?) icing, brad pudding, and a cranberry/marrow pie. All were excellent. Be prepared. There are a lot of flavors here and food that is rich and filling. Just what I like, but I know not for everyone. They did serve a home made dark bread with walnuts. I would suggest sticking with French bread, and keep it coming, just to be authentic to the Louisiana theme they are seeking.Very enjoyable meal with my family on Christmas Eve. "

My wife and I still have mallet marks on our foreheads after this morning's brunch at Big Jones.First, construction detours had us running late for our reservation (for Saturday brunch, one of their truly busy times). I called, apologized; The response was a genuinely, ""We'll do what we can."" What they could turned out to be great understanding and the next available 2-top within 5 minutes of our arrival. The host could not have been more welcoming (except , perhaps, for the owner/exec chef who was with him, greeting customers as if they were entering his home as honored guests). This is and incredibly busy shift for one and all; tables turning like crazy, more diners arriving constantly, tables being moved to accommodate two diners, six diners. You would never know that by seeing the performance of the service staff. Serene, smiling, charming hosts, seemingly interested in nothing but the client's happiness. Rushing (but calmly) themselves, but making it clear that diners could take their time, enjoy the experience, and stay, welcomed, until they were finished. (At the height of brunch at one of Chicago's busiest brunch venues? Who does that anymore?)Ok, now the food, Extraordinary understates it. I don't know what wouldn't understate it except for that mallet to the head. My wife had the Big Jones Benedict. We're talking about a Benedict served on popovers -- not just any popovers. Ham that could make you cry. Mine was the shrimp & grits. Yes, you can get shrimp & grits at who knows how many places in Chicago. But you ain't gettin' shrimp & grits like this. Grits that took me back to trips through South Carolina when I was a kid. Perfect shrimp, perfectly cooked. Tasso ham gravy. (Can we get a posthumous Nobel prize for Mr. Tasso?) It all inspired me a thought to bring harmony to the South.There remains debate about giving up the Stars & Bars in several Southern states. Personally, I've got reservations about how much to glory valor, however glorious, in the cause of treason, but that's me. But why not pick instead a glory shared by one and all in the South, replacing the Stars & Bars with a nice bowl of shrimp & grits?"

I had heard about it on a TV show. The restaurant was next door to one of our favorite neighborhood restaurant in Andersonville. We went on a Monday around 1:30. There were only 7 customers in the restaurant, decorated with prosaic tourism photos of New Orleans and Louisiana. The lighting was outdoor lamps on sconces. I would imagine it could be dark at night.I am not a connoisseur of fried chicken, or its regional subtleties or merits. To me it was fine, not too heavy breading, a tad salty (but I have to disqualify myself on salt issues--I use none) the collards were sour and bitter, and the potatoes I think had made a trip to the freezer. My partner, the connoisseur of chicken said that he could not understand why it was rated so highly. ""Mediocre."" I hadn't had breakfast, so I had ""cajun"" breakfast-- just like in any restaurant except for the Louisiana style boudin. The boudin I know is French. In this one I could not really see much in terms of vegetables nor the distinctive flavor of the French blood sausage. Maybe it was not supposed to be--I know this boudin can be made with any flesh. Our young server was pleasant, and attentive--but at one point we were the only customers! Either way 40 dollars for this type of lunch seemed excessive."

Very nicely decorated and there is a patio outside that may or may not be open. Upon being seated, our server brought us a small plate of beignets to start the meal. Don't get me wrong, but I think I could just come for the beignets and skip the rest of the meal. We picked out three different dishes to try. The first was ""Eugene's Breakfast in Mobile, circa 1930"" which consisted of farm-raised Alabama catfish fried in gold rice and corn flour breading with fried plantains, black beans, and buttered aromatic southern rice. The second was ""Eggs New Orleans"" with Ponchartrain blue crab cakes and poached eggs, popovers, and bearnaise sauce, along with Potatoes O'Brien. Finally we also tried ""Rey's Breakfast Pozole"", which was homemade hominy stewed with local guajillo peppers, onion, and smoked pork shoulder with two poached eggs and special slaw. Each of us thought that the other dishes were as good as the others. The only thing that I might consider offering is one biscuit with the pozole, as the stew does need to be sopped up!

It's as if Paul Fehribach, the executive chef and co-owner, took Big Jones from its location along the Great River Road in the heart of Louisiana's Cajun Country and dropped it at 5347 North Clark Street in Chicago's Andersonville neighborhood. If you love southern style cooking--and who doesn't?--this is the place. Fehribach, a semifinalist for the James Beard Foundation's coveted Best Chef-Great Lakes award in 2013 and 2014, refers to his cuisine as ""Southern heirloom cooking with a focus on sustainably grown heritage and heirloom crops and livestock, sustainable seafood and contemporary American kitchen techniques."" Big Jones brings you brunch, lunch and dinner inspired by the history and richness of Southern cooking from New Orleans, the Gulf Coast, Carolina Lowcountry and Appalachia. Why did it take us so long to find it? We discovered Big Jones on Chicago Eater's list of 38 essential restaurants in Chicago. Until then, we had never heard of it. Big Jones draws raves for its brunch, great biscuits and omelets, Eggs Benedict and grits and gravy. But it's hard to pass up the fried chicken at any time of day. As someone who usually orders Eggs Benedict whenever I find it on a breakfast or brunch menu, however, I can tell you that Big Jones' version ranks among the top five that I have experienced in the last 25 years. The Big Jones Benedict features house-cured and smoked ham simmered in Kilgus Farmstead cream, served on a traditional farmstead biscuit with poached eggs and potatoes O'Brien. Brunch is served Saturday and Sunday from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. and you can't go wrong by ordering the cornbread muffins, Sally Lunn French Toast, Colonial-style Brewster oatmeal, shrimp and grits or Eugene's Breakfast in Mobile, circa 1930, or farm-raised Alabama catfish fried in gold rice and corn flour breading with fried plantains, black beans and buttered aromatic southern rice. For lunch, you have to try the gumbo soup, made Cajun style with chicken, sausage and rice from Arkansas. The fried chicken is to die for, made from Big Jones' own recipe fried in leaf lard, ham drippings and clarified butter and served with reezy-peezy and greens. The shrimp and grits and Farmhouse chicken and dumplings circa 1920 and smoked and smothered pork shoulder also are highly recommended. And how's this for a new idea for a tasty sandwich? The Grilled ham and egg salad, with house-cured ham and egg salad griddled on marble rye with chive cream cheese, pickled pepper sauce and piccalilli. I had to try the Carolina shrimp burger, made in the style of Beaufort, South Carolina, seasoned with lemon and parsley on a soft egg bun with home-made mayo, pickles and butter lettuce. What's for dinner? Start for crab cakes if they aren't too rich for your digestive system. If so, order the gumbo. For an entree, choose the award-winning fried chicken or the Savannah fish fry, crispy catfish in a light corn and rice flour breading, served with creamy grits, hushpuppies, greens and oyster gravy. This is cooking you'd expect to find in Louisiana. But it's a touch of the Old South to find it on the North Side of Chicago."

It's as if Paul Fehribach, the executive chef and co-owner, took Big Jones from its location along the Great River Road in the heart of Louisiana's Cajun Country and dropped it at 5347 North Clark Street in Chicago's Andersonville neighborhood. If you love southern style cooking--and who doesn't?--this is the place. Fehribach, a semifinalist for the James Beard Foundation's coveted Best Chef-Great Lakes award in 2013 and 2014, refers to his cuisine as ""Southern heirloom cooking with a focus on sustainably grown heritage and heirloom crops and livestock, sustainable seafood and contemporary American kitchen techniques."" Big Jones brings you brunch, lunch and dinner inspired by the history and richness of Southern cooking from New Orleans, the Gulf Coast, Carolina Lowcountry and Appalachia. Why did it take us so long to find it? We discovered Big Jones on Chicago Eater's list of 38 essential restaurants in Chicago. Until then, we had never heard of it. Big Jones draws raves for its brunch, great biscuits and omelets, Eggs Benedict and grits and gravy. But it's hard to pass up the fried chicken at any time of day. As someone who usually orders Eggs Benedict whenever I find it on a breakfast or brunch menu, however, I can tell you that Big Jones' version ranks among the top five that I have experienced in the last 25 years. The Big Jones Benedict features house-cured and smoked ham simmered in Kilgus Farmstead cream, served on a traditional farmstead biscuit with poached eggs and potatoes O'Brien. Brunch is served Saturday and Sunday from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. and you can't go wrong by ordering the cornbread muffins, Sally Lunn French Toast, Colonial-style Brewster oatmeal, shrimp and grits or Eugene's Breakfast in Mobile, circa 1930, or farm-raised Alabama catfish fried in gold rice and corn flour breading with fried plantains, black beans and buttered aromatic southern rice. For lunch, you have to try the gumbo soup, made Cajun style with chicken, sausage and rice from Arkansas. The fried chicken is to die for, made from Big Jones' own recipe fried in leaf lard, ham drippings and clarified butter and served with reezy-peezy and greens. The shrimp and grits and Farmhouse chicken and dumplings circa 1920 and smoked and smothered pork shoulder also are highly recommended. And how's this for a new idea for a tasty sandwich? The Grilled ham and egg salad, with house-cured ham and egg salad griddled on marble rye with chive cream cheese, pickled pepper sauce and piccalilli. I had to try the Carolina shrimp burger, made in the style of Beaufort, South Carolina, seasoned with lemon and parsley on a soft egg bun with home-made mayo, pickles and butter lettuce. What's for dinner? Start for crab cakes if they aren't too rich for your digestive system. If so, order the gumbo. For an entree, choose the award-winning fried chicken or the Savannah fish fry, crispy catfish in a light corn and rice flour breading, served with creamy grits, hushpuppies, greens and oyster gravy. This is cooking you'd expect to find in Louisiana. But it's a touch of the Old South to find it on the North Side of Chicago."

They used to serve a large serving of wonderful fried chicken that even allowed for leftovers. Now they serve two small pieces with some wilted greens. It is not tasty and not worth the price.

The biscuits by contrast were small, dry and hard. The butter beans, asparagus, crab cakes and chicken and dumplings were all outstanding. The fried catfish was oddly bland as if someone forgot to add seasoning to the batter.

The restaurant was full but we didn't wait - part of why we chose the place, compared to 30 minutes at Bongo Room. We got a high-top table near the bar. The atmosphere is appealing. It's not a massive restaurant, but is casually stylish, homey and comfortable.I started with a pot of mint tea, they have a nice selection of looseleaf teas both caffeinated and not. I love this, because if I'm paying money for tea at a restaurant I don't want a store-bought teabag in a little mug. At the end of the meal, they added more hot water so that I could enjoy the tea further. Very comforting on a cold day. My friend said her coffee was wonderful.Everyone gets beignets which is a lovely touch. They are sweet and yummy and dusted in powdered sugar. They are light and delicate, and don't have that heavy, fried, crispy feel.

It is catfish breaded in rice and corn flour (so gluten free, I think, if you care), served with black beans, fried plantains, and buttered rice. The batter was light and crispy, almost like a tempura. All of the components of the dish were well cooked, but I felt that the dish really needed salt and was lacking in general seasoning. I added salt and hot sauce but still felt a little disappointed overall. There was a sort of...I don't know, chutney accompaniment that added a sort of tangy flavor, but I still really wanted something more. The server said this dish was her favorite so I was a bit bummed out!I'd happily come back because I know this is a much-loved restaurant with a lot of great dishes.

Some of the menu items (Rutabaga bisque) are unusual; others on the surface at least seem fairly standard (shrimp and grits, fried chicken and biscuits). We had a mix--the bisque was a carefully prepared fluffy soup/mousse, with a range of flavors that melded really well with the texture of the dish. The shrimp and grits was a revelation--shrimp cooked perfectly, mushroom-based ""gravy"" with a complexity to it that balanced the creamy, perfect grits. The biscuit was excellent, with lovely homemade preserves, and the brussels sprouts, now a standard at many restaurants, completely blew us away with their light, citrus/pecan treatment. Wonderful all around. The dessert (bread pudding) was perfectly balanced and tasted like home.

We were not disappointed! We ordered the ""boardinghouse fried chicken"" and were delighted that the chef made it for us even though according to the menu it was a little late in the day to order. Served family-style, the incredible fresh chicken came with mashed potatoes, beans and rice and some of the best greens I've ever had, as well as biscuits and snickerdoodle cookies for dessert, not to mention wonderfully seasoned cornbread to start. I think a lot of Big Jones's ingredients are locally sourced (they identify the origins of many), and it shows. The chicken was deeper-flavored and just more meaty than today's industrial birds, and the breads were obviously freshly baked. Service was friendly without hovering and there was what sounded like rootsy early r & b playing. The space is narrow and deep like many city venues, but since we ate at an off time it wasn't crowded or too noisy.Go with a group -- and walk off your meal by enjoying the neighborhood shopping (and interesting residential areas)."

It's still very good but a little more of a casual place and maybe a notch below what it was 6 or 12 months ago. The atmosphere, in particular, has a more casual feeling to it.The focus is southern cooking, and they still use all local ingredients like before. The cheese grits are great. The gumbo is good, although it's just on the menu as an appetizer. It's a really dark deep brown. All the vegetables are good.

Having recently been in New Orleans, I was missing Cajun/Creole cuisine so I thought I would give this a try. The place was quiet that evening. My friend and I were seated and greeted by a wonderful server named Alex. The menu was interesting and showed a variety of southern delights such as shrimp and grits, andouille sausage, gumbo, fried catfish, and boudin….which is, of course what drew me to the place initially. The menu is available online.After a couple of bourbons, I had the Tête de Cochon Cajun-style (hog's head pâté, made with brandy and peppercorns, with home baked brick bread and house made bourbon & brown sugar mustard - $5) – it was tasty, but unfortunately only one piece of this wonderful pate, the Pecan Wood-Fired Oyster Roast (Virginia oysters cooked over a wood fire with a Creole mignonette, garlic butter and bread crumbs -$17) – cooked perfectly and excellent flavour and the grilled asparagus (served with chopped egg and anchovy vinaigrette and bread crumbs -$7). My friend had the tasso ($5) and crawfish etoufee ($23). The tasso was not quite as spicy as I’ve had, but very flavorful and well prepared nonetheless. The crawfish etoufee was really tasty and you’d have thought you were in New Orleans. We had a malbec ($50). We had an excellent meal. The restaurant is in the north end of the city, but I would certainly say this is worth the trip. I was staying downtown. It was about a $25.00 taxi ride. The restaurant is licensed. In addition to the wine, they have a good size whiskey list. Highly recommended. I will definitely be back."

The lemon panacotta dessert was wonderful, as well, as good as the best I had when living in Rome for a year.

Heaven.Full disclosure: This was my second visit--the first visit was about a year and a half ago, and we found the food equally delicious, although that summer night the restaurant was packed to the brims and our waiter was inattentive at best (we like lingering at meals but that time it took the waiter 35 minutes to even come to our table, another 15 minutes to bring us wine etc--I noticed that waiter fromt he first time was still working there, but he was not our waiter this time around). This time around service was a completely different experience--super attentive warm service, a terrific (different) waiter who hit the perfect balance between being welcoming, efficient and warm..yet not intrusive. the difference is service may have been because this time we arrived far earlier on a weeknight so it was not at all crowed at the start of the evening or perhaps because we were with a friend of the owner.

But I read several other reviews from TripAdvisor contributors who detailed an ""excellent dining experience"" and ""an evening to remember."" You can't win 'em all, right? So we decided to make the long drive north on Clark Street. We're glad we did. Have you ever had orecchiette? I'd never heard of it until then. The waiter recommended it. ""Give it a try. You'll love it,"" he said. All he had riding on his recommendation was his tip, right? Well, orecchiette is wonderful. And you're hearing this from a guy who wouldn't touch a plate of catfish until a waitress in Donaldson, Louisiana, changed my way of thinking. Orecchiette is a home-made pasta typical of Puglia or Apulia, a region in southern Italy. Its name comes from its shape, which resembles a small ear. It contains broccoli or rapini, sweet pork sausage or miniature meatballs, garlic cloves. tomato-based sauce and a sprinkling of ricotta cheese. Delicious. The waiter earned an extra dollar. The thing about Anteprima is it is a break away from the ordinary. I'm not an expert on Italian food but my wife's relatives came from the old country so she has a pretty good education on the subject. Start with salumi, Italian cold cuts...salami, mortadella, prosciutto, bresaola. It comes with house-flavored olives and fresh and hot breadsticks. I'm not into grilled octopus or wood-grilled whole fish. But the pastas, especially orecchiette with lamb sausage and tagiatelle with pancetta ragu, were exceptional. So was the rigatoni with Italian sausage and the risotto with shrimp and lobster cream. And you haven't even ordered the main course yet. How about pancetta wrapped pork loin with parmigiano potatoes, glazed carrots and spinach? Or brick-grilled crisp baby chicken? Or sliced New York strip? Or grilled duck sausage with sweet potato puree? The menu changes from week to week so you might have a choice of veal or osso buco or lamb or quail. I'm told the wine list is exceptional, too. I've been to a lot of Italian restaurants but Anteprima separates itself from others, I think, because the food really has a genuine home-made flavor. Ownership claims their regionally inspired, rustic Italian food comes from recipes they have learned in homes throughout Italy. ""You're not likely to find many of our dishes elsewhere,"" they say. I won't argue the point."

Make no mistake, this is not a ""red sauce on pasta"" restaurant. The menu varies significantly from day to day depending on what's available and there are dishes that I have never seen other places. The ingredients are combined creatively and I have found the service to be very prompt. Most of the pastas are made in house and taste like someone's ""nonna"" made them. Seafood figures prominently as do the roasted meats. The baby chicken is always delicious. The pork and lamb choices change frequently but are always great. If I could roast meats like that at home I might be more excited about my upcoming kitchen remodel! The waiters have extensive knowledge of the menu and are helpful with wine pairings as well.  The atmosphere is warm and as other reviewers have said, it is bustling and can be a little loud on a Saturday night. It is almost always busy....rain, snow or shine and the crowd is eclectic. The Andersonville neighborhood has really blossomed in recent years and the diners at Anteprima reflect the variety of the area. Sunday to Thursday they offer a 3 course menu...starter, half pasta and a main dish for about $29. It's a great deal, especially in city where dinner for two is routinely north of $100. There are two other restaurants next door, Ombra and Acre with the same owner. Each has a different flavor but I always gravitate to Anteprima. There's an outdoor patio in the back that is thankfully away from the street, not on top of it like many outdoor spaces. When dining out with friends this is always near the top of the list. Even my hard to please family declared it the closest thing to a dinner in Italy. It's a great place for a weeknight dinner or vibrant Saturday night.

Tables are small by design and make for no room for any of the service, glasses, dishes, etc. All in all a very unpleasant dining experience.Of course, none of this info is known to diners until they get into the restaurant and get caught up in the mayhem. Clearly, this Owner is squeezing all that he can get by filling the room way beyond its legal occupancy levels. If it is a qiet night, am thinking that this spot would be much better experience but if you catch it on overloaded night, buyer beware. Pretty troubling when restaurant review doesn't concern itself with review of food. My ears are still ringing and its Tuesday morning. For five persons, our bill was close to $300.00 with drinks, tip, dessert, etc. Pretty much a waste when experience was down right numbing."

You can probably count on a drink after 30 minutes, a salad delivered 30 minutes later, the appetizer served 30 minutes later, the soup served 30 minutes later, the entrees delivered 30 minutes later and dessert. I guess that accounts for 8:30-11:00 P.M.Let's just say with so many wonderful restaurants in Chicago to choose from this probably shouldn't be your first choice.

My buffalo mozzarella with tomatoes, to my surprise, was served without olive oil or balsamic vinegar, and was garnished with three tiny pieces of basil. We both ordered small portions of the spaghetti with rock shrimp and tomatoes as an entree. When it was served to us, mine was the dinner portion, and both arrived without spoons for the pasta.

My only complaints are minor. You have to find parking on the street, usually, and the cafe is very noisy unless weather is warm and you sit on the patio out back. I enjoyed a wonderful light dinner. The salad with heirloom tomatoes, thin slices of watermelon, and diced cucumber, dressed with olive oil, lemon juice, and mint, was delicious, the perfect choice on a muggy August evening. A small order of farfalle with prosciutto ragu was also wonderful, such a rich dish that a small portion was satisfying. The sauce was so good, I cleaned the plate with pieces of bread while nobody was looking. Our waiter was courteous and helpful, offering insightful recommendations when asked. The lady's stuffed calamari was an unfamiliar dish, but in a good way, entirely different from the usual boring rendition of breaded and fried squid with a dollop of cocktail sauce. Anteprima is a storefront, and does not offer a great deal of elbow room, that's unfortunate, but every aspect of the experience was somewhere between very satisfactory, and excellent.

Great Italian wine selections at very reasonable prices are an added bonus.

Then, the food was good, the meat was tender, the rice was nicely done and the service was great. I am visiting Chicago and I thought I should pay Reza’s a visit. I made the effort to take an Uber from where I live in down town to Clark street. The overall experience was disappointing. The bread was a far cry from any Iranian bread, the meat was not properly marinated and the rice was not cooked well. On top of this, the service was a little weird. I was nearly pushed out of my table before finishing my tea.I wanted to pay by credit card and the waiter was openly in favor of cash! I had to go to the cash box to pay my bill. Since I was neither happy with the food nor the service, I didn’t feel obliged to give any tip. Where I come from, the tip is a token of appreciation not a given right. The waiter followed me to the street asking for his tip!I will never go back again to this Reza’s. "

The food was good, and the waiter was not unpleasant at all, just not the best server I've had. Food did not take long. We ordered lamb, chicken, and beef kabobs and all three varieties were very tasty. We were too full for dessert, but I was intrigued and would like to return some time and attempt dessert. An interesting note. The bathroom is downstairs and the stalls are not what I would call secure. Though I latched the doors, someone came in and pulled the doors open before realizing I was there. Additionally, to reach the bathroom you have to walk through the back room and there was what appeared to be a wedding taking place in the back room. The music was quite loud and disorienting, but I also loved seeing people lauging, dancing and celebrating. It was...strange and wonderful at the same time.I liked this place and I would like the opportunity to return with my family sometime. A good place for celebrating and for families, but I would steer clear for business meetings."

We happened to be in the Andersonville area on a beautiful Saturday afternoon, however, so decided to give Reza's another try-are we glad we did! Our service was wonderful by a very personable Kurdish young lady (sorry can't recall her first name- it started with a B!). We started with an order of hummus which was fantastic! I make my own hummus from dried beans so am very picky about my hummus. The flat bread served with it was fresh out of the oven and a very generous portion. We all had the chicken and barley soup with our meals- it was good, but could have used maybe a tad more seasoning. All three of us got the kebab combinations and the flavors of the beef, lamb and chicken were all spot on! I have been to a few Persian restaurants lately where the kebabs were dry and under-seasoned but these were very moist and juicy and the flavor was great! At the end, we were pleasantly surprised by the bill- three meals and three beverages came out to a nice and reasonable evening out!! I highly recommend Reza's!!"

The dessert, which was sort of a cross between a churro and a sopapilla, was one of the best I've ever had. The restaurant itself is large with a really interesting layout with bathroom downstairs and additional stairs winding up to a second floor. The only downside is that the neighborhood it is in is not family-friendly at all. Just as one example of many, a few doors down is a store selling sexually explicit crack pipes. Definitely come eat here, but leave the kids at home."

Offering daily specials and chef specials, we started with a flavourful baba ganooj appetizer dressed with parsley, radish and feta on the side; generous servings of fresh baked flat bread were served as well. Soup followed, a rich chicken barley broth subtly flavoured. Our entrees included roasted quail, thick cut lamb chops and chopped lamb souvlaki; instead of the vegetables offered, the chef prepared grilled salted vegetable, a rich and generous assortment of carrots, onions, zucchini and peppers. Hard pressed to finish such a full plate of food, our take out boxes seemed fuller than the food we’d been served. Before we could think about dessert, our attentive server appeared with a silver tray of cakes, puddings and baclava. The baclava was rich with nuts and drizzled with honey. As the meal ended, all I could think about was a reason to return for another round of Persian Home Cooking"

Most of the food quality is still quite good, but they've made some cuts in service that have led to problems in some areas, at least in our recent week-night samplings. We've found in the last couple of months that there will be only one or two servers in the main dining area. You would think that would be fine, given that in these times only a handful of tables might be occupied. But an oxymoronic effect kicks in that I've also seen on flights that are 10% full - there's a chance the staff takes the light work load as a quasi-day off. We've seen this at Reza's several times, wondering why it can be so hard to ask for a drink refill when there are one or two other active tables in the room. Also, they've gone to a buffet for soup and salad on weeknights. Not a horrible idea given the light traffic in the recession, but the stale pita that came with it was a great disappointment, given how avoidable it is."

She was very attentive and nice. We decided to eat the Viking breakfast and place another order of pancakes. The breakfast was wonderful and the pancakes were exactly like those that I had been eating in Sweden two weeks before. The prices are inexpensive and two people can eat very heartily under $25.00.

Also quality coffees from local brewers. On our most recent visit, we had a Tropical Breeze shake, coconut ice cream with pineapple topping, a Chocolate Explosion sundae with award-winning Zanzibar chocolate ice cream made with three kinds of cocoa and toppings of M&Ms, chocolate chips and hot fudge and George's one-of-a-kind delight, Geor-Gantic, five scoops of ice cream (we chose butter pecan, chocolate chip, cookie dough, peach and chocolate coconut) on top of a bed of brownie pieces with waffle chips around a waffle shake with a hand-dipped chocolate pretzel served with hot fudge, hot caramel and sprinkles. We didn't finish it all, of course, so we took it home with pints of rainbow sherbet, Zanzibar chocolate and neapolitan, which features vanilla, strawberry and Zanzibar chocolate swirled together.

George's Ice Cream & Sweets,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g35805-d1480973-Reviews-George_s_Ice_Cream_Sweets-Chicago_Illinois.html,"January 31, 2017",5,George's Party Room is a popular destination,"My wife and I have been on an ice cream expedition lately, canvasing the Chicago area to discover the best ice cream parlors. Even in cold and snowy weather, it's hard to pass up a tasty chocolate sundae or strawberry milk shake or a bowl...of butter pecan or chocolate chip or coconut ice cream or rainbow sherbet. So our quest continues. One of our most recent stops was at George's Ice Cream & Sweets at 5306 North Clark Street in Chicago's Andersonville neighborhood. Opened in 2009 by the Soltis family, it is a tribute to George Soltis, who was the proprietor of the Chicago Recycle Shop next door for almost 30 years and dreamed of opening his own coffee shop or restaurant. George's offers 32 flavors of ice cream, milk shakes, sundaes, cones, Italian ice, cakes, cupcakes and crepes. Ice cream flavors include black cherry, cinnamon, coconut, chocolate, chocolate chip, chocolate raspberry, butter pecan, cookie dough, Dutch vanilla, French vanilla, Rocky Road, vanilla custard, salted caramel, Mackinac Island fudge, pistachio, strawberry, egg nog, pumpkin, key lime pie, peach, lemon meringue, root beer float and caramel apple pie. Also orange, rainbow and raspberry sherbet. How about a German chocolate cake sundae, coconut almond bliss ice cream with a brownie, caramel, hot fudge and pecans? Or a Zoreo, Zanzibar chocolate ice cream with marshmallow ripple, Oreos and soft chocolate chunks? And don't forget George's Party Room, a popular location for children's birthday parties or other special occasions. Build your own sundaes and choose your favorite ice cream flavors. Which one is best? That's like trying to find the best ice cream parlor in Chicago. One thing's for sure, George's is on the list.More"

Because of this and because of the longer than average wait, I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 stars. However, I think I would order an egg dish next time because I remember them as being very good.

The other two in our party had a breakfast burrito (said it was one of the best she had ever tasted) and the breakfast casserole. I got to taste that casserole and want the recipe. YUM!Taste of Heaven has about 10 tables (We did not notice the outside seating until too late). On this morning, there were few customers; most of them seemed to be local. Several people stopped in to pick up a coffee and pastry to go. Service was a bit slow because one server (very friendly) was taking care of everybody inside for quite awhile; another server showed up later.A sign in the window says something about children using inside voices. It made me chuckle. As DH and I are both retired school teachers, we like the attitude! Writing this makes me remember the loud child at the table next to us at Ann Sather's. Not fun.

The best part was that a friendly sign was posted on the door that asked children to ""please behave"" and use their ""indoor voices."" A delightful change from other restaurants that I have been to and left because some parents weren't doing their job and let the little ones run all over the restaurant disturbing everyone else. I would recommend this restaurant to EVERYONE."

Sure, good behavior carries a certain degree of subjectivity...Unfortuantely, a handful of parents (who are wrong to think that they're entitled to let their children make dining out uncomfortable for others) are giving all parents a bad reputation.I'm a dog owner...do I have the right to walk down the street letting my dog lung at anyone and everyone? Just because I own a dog and want to walk down the street? Think about it. Parents who don't want to teach their children public manners need to keep their children out of the public.Children don't entitle people to do whatever they wish, however they wish."

(Check out recent articles in the Chicago Tribune and Time Out) He claims children are welcome, but if that's true why put up the nasty sign? Wait staff is extremely UNFRIENDLY to children.

The chef brought it to the table and described it as a ""smiley face."" Gasp-inducing.I ordered it ""medium"" and the beef was rare. My friend ordered Baked Chicken and he got the vegetarian pasta dish, instead. We literally could not flag down our waiter for five minutes to tell us that the expeditor gave us the wrong dish. How on earth is this place still open?"
Vincent,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g35805-d2454356-Reviews-Vincent-Chicago_Illinois.html,"July 27, 2020",2,Safe outdoor dining; terrible food,"We visited on an Friday evening in July 2020.On the plus side, the restaurant did a very good job with safe dining during the COVID-19 pandemic. The street in-front of the restaurant was closed, and tables were on the street very far apart (well over 6 feet) from each other. Servers wore masks. Orders were placed online before visiting, drink menus were paper and disposable, and all drinks and food were delivered to a “clean” table in the center of the outdoor area for you to then pick-up. Similarly, you bussed your own dishes to a “dirty” table. Staff stayed well over 6 feet away from the table. All of that system worked well. Additionally, our server was fun and reasonably attentive.On the negative side, the online reservation and ordering system was confusing and inaccurate. You pick a specific table (they all have names), but is is unclear that you are doing so (it only made sense when a friend of ours in the neighborhood stopped-by and saw the labeled tables). Oddly, although we were a table of four, we could only place orders for up to 2 of each item—meaning that if all four us happened to want the same, say, appetizer, it would not be available. Additionally, we booked a 7:30pm table, and the confirmation then said 6:30pm. This was cleared-up with a call to the restaurant. So, the website could use some improvement.Also on the negative side: most of the food. Appetizers were good—a salad was fresh and a corn dish with caramelized onion was tasty. Unfortunately, things went downhill from there. Roasted chicken was under-seasoned and a little rubbery; the croutons with which it was served were soggy rather than crisp, and the greens too bitter. A major disappointment, though, was the mushroom agnolotti, which was pretty much inedible. There was barely any mushroom, the pasta was drastically undercooked (and thus had the texture of wallpaper paste), and the sauce was gloopy and looked like Elmer’s glue. Desserts were sadly not better: a pot de creme was too thick and cloyingly sweet and a sherbet tasted like chemicals and was served with an unpleasant and undercooked biscuit. Although we all had a great time socializing and enjoyed the outdoor dining and scene that Vincent had created, and were grateful for that, we were also all surprised—previous visits had far better food. We commented as we left that we basically at the food because we were starving and it was some of the worst restaurant food we’d ever had. Hopefully things get better as the round out the outdoor menu."

Hadn't been to Vincent's for several years... friend picked out of other A-villed options. Overall I recommend. Service could have been a little more on point, but I think they may have been short-staffed. We had four cocktails (two honey & jalapeno and two sazeracs), two apps (bread and pickle pot). Drinks were delicious. I think the apps were way overpriced. Bread and butter, four pieces was $7. Ridiculous. We rounded out our dining experience with Mussels & Frites (mussels were plentiful / generous and fries nice), Pork Chop, Gnocchi and Chicken Liver Mousse. Fries were nicely seasoned and crisp, mousse was tasty, but could have been a bit more liver forward, gnocchi good but a bit mushy and pork chop nicely done. We also had a bottle of the Bedrock Zin which was delicious -- marked up about 100% from retail. We finished with a tasty chocolate pudding shared amongst us.

White wine and garlic mussels were good if a bit on the tiny side. The frites were amazing as was the bread served with the mussels. Cheeseboard was good but should have been served at room temp not straight from the fridge. Everyone seemed to be ordering burgers so we did too, but instead of a fried egg, it was more like a barely cooked and very runny poached egg. BF said his steak was perfectly cooked and very tender.

WRONG. The place just about drowns out any possibility of conversation with the folks at your table, and to make matters worse, I think the Maitre'D was friends with the table next to us, and he kept coming over and talking in full voice as well as the diners, so even though I didn't want to be part of their conversation I was. Really impacted our table in a bad way. The mussels were delicious, but that was about all that was remarkable. The risotto was OK, the Waldorf salad minuscule, and we kept having to ask for more bread.

Trust your server to pick out a few cheeses to either start or finish your meal. And don't miss the market salad which is simple but not boring and the mussels. Note that if you like beef, chicken, and pork, you will have plenty of options, but if you're limiting to seafood or veg, there will probably be only one dinner plate on the menu for you."

A large choice of appetizers, a nice list of main courses including two types of burgers, and mussels prepared four different ways gaves this cute little bistro a nice following in the busy Andersonville neighborhood. When we arrrived, a bit after 6:00 p.m., the place was empty, but was full upon leaving with a sax player and guitar man making music outside. A nice touch. Vincent has speciality drinks, thatseem to be ubiquitous in all hot city restaurants, and a small but nice wine by the glass list. Our server was good, explained dishes as needed and was nicely attentive. Now the food. We shared the burrata plate, my friend had the lamb burger with very crisp frites, my wife had the mussels, in the curry broth, and while the quantity was good, the mussels themselves, were quite small. Lots of places are bringing crisp toasted bread with their mussels. However, this was not the case a Vincent. This also came with crispy frites, and I had the hanger steak. No frites, but pearl onions instead. With this I had a glass of Cotes du Rhone at $10, which surprisingly, is a nice price for a glass of wine in todays food market(many upscale places are charging $14 and up for a glass of wine), and for dessert we split the chocolate mousse. Oh, they bring nice warm baguattes in paper to the table with a garlic tasting butter. All in all, it was a pleasent meal, in a place you can hear yourself talk. Good food, and good service. What more can you ask for. Used to be La Tache at one time, and also, had a Norwegian style menu at one time. Now, more French Bistro, and better for it."

I've been to Vincent countless times, and they never fail to deliver cordial service and excellent food. The menu isn't overly extensive (always a good sign); what they do, they do well - contemporary American dishes (with a touch of French bistro) executed perfectly. Charcuterie and cheese are highlights; let them choose and you won't be disappointed. As for mains, the fish and pork dishes range from very good to sublime, and the burger is dependably delicious. I normally gravitate towards more adventurous food, but at Vincent, even the simple hanger steak is a standout, cooked perfectly (they do ""rare"" right) with just the right accompanying veggies (think pearl onions and asparagus). The creative cocktails are also outstanding, most notably the cork, oak and kinfolk and the surprisingly awesome bubbles and flowers. Regarding the latter: when two whiskey drinkers (my wife and I) love something that frilly, it has to be particularly good. On top of this, the restaurant itself is cozy, perfectly lit (this matters!), and the owner Mike is one of the best people ever. Every time I leave from a meal here, I feel warm, fuzzy, happy - and oddly accomplished, like I just did something amazing.So glad this place exists.

So my wife and I visited First Slice Pie Cafe at 5357 North Ashland Avenue in Chicago's Andersonville neighborhood. Under the culinary guidance of chef Mary Ellen Diaz, who earned her stripes while working at North Pond, Printer's Row and Lettuce Entertain You, First Sliced Pie Cafe has emerged as a popular destination for freshly baked fruit and cream pies, quiche, soups, salads and sandwiches. She also has locations at 4401 North Ravenswood in the Lillstreet Art Center, 4664 North Manor Street and 1823 Church Street in Evanston. The Andersonville address is open from 10 to 9 Monday through Thursday, 10 to 10 on Friday, 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. on Saturday and 10 to 8 on Sunday. You come for the pies. Apple is as good as advertised. But key lime and French silk and chocolate peanut better and chocolate cream and strawberry rhubarb are extraordinary, too. However, you are encouraged to stay for lunch...roasted tomato soup, turkey chili, cobb salad, pesto tortellini salad, chicken and bleu cheese sandwich, green lasagna. Of course, we had to take a pie home. But which one? If only one, it has to be apple, right? Food & Wine wasn't wrong."

The seafood panjun was very fresh, excellent. The batter for the vegetable tempura a bit heavier than I remember. The chop chae's beef a tad chewy; the bulkogi a tad steamed. Both, however flavorful and delicious. I knew better than to eat a lot of the squid..fiery. I don't know the prices of the cocktails , but at 120 it seemed a fair price.

The restaurant itself is nicely decorated and lit. The music-perfect! Rhonda, our waitperson, provided excellent suggestions and even provided us with suggestions for eating there in the future. My husband loves a certain dish not on the menu and Rhonda told us to give them a little notice and they could fix that meal for us. How much better of a dining experience can you have?

But that seems selfish.Where to start? With the food of course. Everything we have tried has been terrific. A big hit in our family is the cheddar bacon pancakes, which have been listed as a special for a long time, so we're thinking they will go on the menu the next time they print new menus. Because we hadn't tasted other cheddar bacon pancakes, we can't compare them. But they are certainly unique and the sweet and savory combo works. Plus, as with any pancakes on the menu that we've ordered, you get a side of strawberries and some of the most amazing whipped cream ever. (The closest we've come to them is the cheddar and bacon potato pancakes at Ann Sathers, but the negative is they don't have much of the sweet taste, only the savory one. However, Ann Sathers of course has the best cinnamon rolls in the universe so at the end of the day, who really cares if the entrée isn't the best?)I often get a cheddar and spinach omelet. It's not on the menu but since the ingredients are both listed in other combos, I figured I'd give it a shot, and it worked. Why I like this omelet more than some others is it's fluffy. That's kind of how I think an omelet should be. It comes with your choice of toast and a side of Pauline's potatoes, which have not just onions but also peppers for a little bit of a kick. My husband tried the bread pudding French toast. I'm not a bread pudding lover so I didn't take a bite but he said it was hard to imagine that together these two things -- bread pudding and French toast -- could be even better together than they would be separately, But they were! And he too got a side of strawberries and the fabulous whipped cream (as if he needed anything else sweet to eat).I will say, however, that while Pauline's isn't expensive, it's not the cheap eats I expected. I figured a hole in the wall on the corner of a largely residential area would be a bargain -- maybe I was thinking something like $15 for two, that kind of bargain. Well, it's not that kind of bargain, but it is still less expensive than what I'd call a moderate restaurant. Oh, and look for the guy outside with his bird. 'Nuf said about him."

The biscuits and gravy: Soft bread that soaked up what little gravy there was, and two or three small bits of sausage - but uninspired taste. I routinely forgive poor biscuits and gray in the North - will I ever learn? But my friends got ""extra large five-egg omelettes"" - perhaps they were extra-large quail eggs; never have I seen such small, flat omelettes. The water glasses spent more time empty than full, one friend's ""crispy"" bacon was charred, and they were less-than-gracious about one' s friend food allergies to the point that she asked if they would prefer us to leave? The aftermath: Please don't ask me how the food was unless you are prepared for an honest answer, and intend to do something about it besides offering your condolences.

Their omelets used to be big and delicious. Today I ordered an egg white vegetable omelet and they charge an additional 1.95$ for egg whites and there was barely enough egg whites to hold the vegetable in the omelet.

Although we sat at a table right next to the kitchen, it wasn't bothersome at all. A high wall separated us from the activity in the kitchen, and my friend and I were able to talk at a normal tone. We were happy to find free street parking steps away from the entrance. The restaurant is located in a residential area, with a pleasant garden softening the presence of the Metra railroad tracks. I was impressed that the restaurant pays tribute to Pauline, the owner, who has passed away. A refreshing oasis in the city!"

Our lunch was good and the ham and bean soup that came with our sandwiches was very good. The service was attentive and the prices were very modest. Pauline's is a good value.The breakfast menu looked terrific too and we'll have to give that a try on a future trip to Chicago.The decor is very distinctive. Bring your kids to take them to the kind of restaurant you or your parents might have gone to decades ago. It's special.There is outdoor seating too and it's on a not so busy street so the noise level outside isn't as bad as you'd find on Clark Street. The downside is the people watching is less fun.Only thing I'd change is the soft drinks. There is a reason why Coke and Pepsi products dominate....they taste good. RC and Diet Rite just don't cut it.

Generally, I would say the food is among the b est you can find for breakfast.the service was acceptable and it all depends on who your server is. I would classify the service as typical of a diner. The staff was good at checking to make sure the coffee level didn't go down. While I never did get my toast with the omlet, I don't think I could have eaten it with a side of pancakes - and I am not too sure if the server didn't misunderstand me and just bring the pancakes instead of the toast. I found the server to be polite and attentive, but not extraordinary.The place was very crowded - it was a beautiful day and they had folks sitting outside eating at the tables on the sidewalk and while there was no line when we arrived, by the time we left, there were people waiting.All things considered, I think we will return for future visits - we enjoyed it and found it to be a pleasant experience.We had a car and could drive here, but for visitors, unless you have a car, it may be difficult to find without some advance planning.

If you have the money to spare, or you want to make an impression, this is a very solid place."

Pastries are very good, including croissants, lingonberry tarts, pie (by the slice), cookies, cinnamon buns, sweet breads and even cardamon buns. They serve coffee, drinks, teas, etc. You can buy wonderful bakery breads, but unfortunately the day I visited there was no limpa :-( We did enjoy sitting in the open window and watch the people walk by. It's the kind of place I'd want to go to everyday if I could. Staff is friendly and efficient. They take credit cards."

However with the high quality comes a very high price. Service was very pleasant. A sampling of lox, Swedish pickled herring, and specialty cheeses was also pricey given the small quantities provided. The $24 plate of Swedish meatballs was notable (the meatballs were larger than average, but this price was over the top)."

The atmosphere is really beautiful. I am not Danish, nor have I visited a Scandinavian country to say this is authentic or not. But the dinner service is very hygge (cozy). I went by myself and orderd a light dinner but they have substantial proteins on the menu, although it is not big.Their focus on everything is high quality sourcing which runs through their beverage list. They call themselves ""natural wine"" focused but the wine selections are broad but all the producers use few chemicals and low to no sulfur. Their cocktails are limited but thoughtful, I had the ""punch"" which was a very cozy cocktail, reminiscent of Christmastime, cinnamon and rum without being too sweet because of the citrus added to it. So if you are visiting Chicago and just tired of the very homogenous tourist scene for the most part, take an Uber to Andersonville and try LL. I do suggest reservations because it is tiny but it gives you an idea of some of the creative, artisanal cafes in Chicago. The prices are not cheap but reasonable to the level of craftmanship in the food, it is not expense account driven like most of the restaurants in the tourist areas.Andersonville is nice area to walk around after dinner. I work in the tourist area so it was just so nice to be in a lovely, cozy spot for a relaxed, delicious meal. Make a reservation!"

But enough of it that I find a range of things to enjoy. They've got a range of vegetarian food, without being new agey about it. The egg and bean burrito is my favorite: about the size of my head, with steamed eggs. I'm fussy about eggs, and these come out tender but cooked through. The coffee's great, and they've got a beer and wine license now (or did last time I was there)The down side: The restaurant's cramped to the point of tripping over other customers' belongings and body parts at peak times, but everyone's good-humored about it, shuffling knees and coats and packages about to make room.

I was expecting something resembling scrambled eggs with vegetables, as it was on the breakfast menu and came with wholegrain bread. What I got was a small cup of tofu cubes in salty broth with two tiny, soggy broccoli pieces. For the price, it was subpar and I left hungry.

It’s kind of like saying, “That’s the best sex without touching someone I’ve ever had.” I don’t understand and I don’t care for it. However, based on my wife's raving, if your philosophy or dietary requirements lean you towards such items, it will be perfect for you. As for me, I devoured scrambled eggs and refried beans wrapped in a spinach tortilla. It was very tasty and as for my plate, the eggs and beans were real – as far as I know.Within, there is a seating area (including a Moraccan style floor sitting area) bakery case and a little shop with a slew of Lonely Planet books covering the entire planet.

Very disappointing experience. Every element fell short.The atmosphere stinks. We were at a table shoved into a corner in a windowless back room that felt like it was from the 1970s, down to the fake wood paneling. The table next to us remained uncleared from the previous party for several minutes. The music was an odd collection of 1970s and 1980s classics and slightly too loud. The bathrooms were disgusting, right down to a sign that asked you to put your toilet paper in a bin by the toilet because the toilet would clog if you flushed it.The service was slow. We were not recognized at our table for several minutes. It also took a long time to receive the check.The food was outright bad. We attempted to order house salads with ginger dressing. They were out of the ginger dressing and thus not serving salads. We ordered seaweed salads instead; the two we ordered tasted different, with one totally lacking flavor and sauce. Vegetable tempura were disappointing; the tempura batter had absolutely no flavor whatsoever, and the dipping sauce looked and tasted like brown water (also flavorless). We ordered four sushi rolls. All four lacked flavor; we all commented that grocery store sushi is better. Particularly off-putting was the spider roll; the fried soft shell crab had sand in it, lending a gritty texture, and one end of the roll was inedible, because the crab had taken-on a prune-like texture. After eating at many sushi places around the country, I have to say this one was the absolute worst. Avoid."

This review is for the original Tanoshii which sits near the end of the Clark Street section of Andersonville on the east side of the road. Street parking is typically not an issue and the restaurant is easy to find, as it's just across the street from the Jewel grocery store. The Andersonville location is BYOB; they gladly provide glasses and ice to keep your beverage of choice cold. The dining room is divided into two sections a larger room, available for overflow, larger parties or private events. The main entry and dining area features a long sushi bar with several seats, a comfortable number of tables all of which afford a view of the sushi bar and can be arranged for larger parties. The staff is friendly but busy as the room fills up and requires a good deal of attention throughout the evening to keep things in order. The main attraction is Tanohsii's unique approach to rolls and the fresh ingredients, which cannot be said for every sushi restaurant in this city. The menu covers many different styles of roll, ranging from savory to sweet, each brought to the table designed to be enjoyed with the combination of sauces and flavors they are delivered with, no soy dipping required (Adding soy sauce is actually frowned on). The nigiri and sashimi are fresh and appropriately sized with appetizers one would expect to see on a sushi restaurant’s menu, It’s important to note the rolls are not traditional rolls but instead an interesting array of surprisingly tasty and unexpected culinary pairings. As a tip, if you’re up for a bit of menu roulette, provide the server with any food considerations (allergies or other preferences) and request the Sushi chefs prepare a selection of rolls suitable for the table; we’re never disappointed as they are always good. For a real treat, call ahead several days before your go and request whole Lobster Sushi, a real treat and a fun way to celebrate a special event, or just a good excuse to eat fresh tasty lobster prepared several different ways."

Andie's takes the whole Mediterranean as its province and executes that notion very well. it's a spacious restaurant with a low noise level and wait staff and management that really seems to care. They are happy to explain everything, even recommending what they like. We started with a Middle East and Greek appetizer: spinach cheese pie, hummus and felafel. Greek Lemon Chicken soup followed. The woman of the trio ordered Osso Bucco made with lamb, I had the lamb tagging with couscous, and my friend had the basil chicken in a saffron sauce. All plated and displayed very well, Good wine selection; many good bottles by the glass from the Med area. I ordered retsina, not much seen out of Greek restaurants. It's made with pine resin. There are many vegetarian and vegan offerings (Moroccan eggplant, curry vegetable couscous) that there is really something for everyone, even kids. The Clark St. strip in Andersonville is getting better and better as a dining destination and Andie's -- now in that community for 30 years--still has the same chef owner Andie Tamras.

That was the best chicken I ever had in any restaurant, anywhere, and it was definitely worth the little extra wait. Definitely not frozen / reheated as in most other restaurants, including much higher priced ones. The turkish beer and sangria were good also. The water did not have too much ice, again unlike many other restaurants. The pita bread before the appetizer also was great by itself. The setting is nice, and the restaurant is located in a street with a lot of activities / window shopping. A review would not be complete without pointing the little minuses too: the menu is a bit confusing to figure everything out, as there are so many choices. I would recommend hiring a graphic designer, to make things a little clearer... but it's not a big deal. Also there was a little pricing mistake on our receipt (just $2 over) but the manager was *very* nice and she took care of it / also giving us a free desert to go, and a $5 coupon for our next visit.

We started with the appetizer sampler and it was astonishing. The baba ganouj is smoky and subtle; the hummus is bright and fresh; and the harressa was brilliant on the plate and on the tongue. Our entrees were equal to the starters, with chicken and lamb subtly seasoned and served over the most wonderful dilled rice. I saved half my entree for lunch the next day, and the flavors of the chicken and artichokes in white wine sank into the rice and were a wonderful cold salad. The prices are very reasonable, especially for the portions, and there is a good wine list and a house sangria. We sat indoors, but next to wide doors that open onto the sidewalk dining area, and felt like we were in the Mediterranean. I highly recommend this place, which is easy to reach by the bus going up Clark Street, even if you are downtown in the Loop."

However, we arrived at 8:20 and the food didn't arrive until 8:55. The restaurant was only a quarter full and we ordered simple things, but I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's start with the service. Sam, our waiter, had the personality of a tree. I attempted to make light talk, but that didn't work. He had no recommendations and simply pointed out the specials on the menu without describing them. I thought maybe I was over exaggerating; however, my companion mentioned it as soon as the waiter walked away. Hmm. Not a good sign. Finally, when the food arrived, I was prepared to eat anything. We ordered some appetizers and one entree to share. I said to bring whatever was done out first. Instead, everything came out at the same time. We had the dates as an appetizer. They were okay. We also had the Balek, which was a lamb spring roll. It was pretty good, but then again, fried food usually is. We had the special mint salad. We both hated it and felt we were choking on the herbs that they added. Finally, we had the Vegetable platter with hummus, baba ganoush, feta and spinach pie, and garlic dip. This was pretty good, but we had already ate pita bread while waiting for the food, so we were kind of over the pita by this point. I don't usually blame a restaurant for the quality of service; however, this was the trifecta that warranted a low rating."

We went on a Saturday afternoon and the restaurant was not very busy... should have been a sign. We ordered the calamari appetizer - sounded great on the menu, not so great when delivered. For our main course, we had the falafel and avocado wrap. The avocado was hard and tough to bite (seriously, it snapped when you bit it, it was that unripe) and there were two small pieces of falafel in the wrap. The fries looked good, but were soggy and had no flavor. Not worth the stop - we left hungry."

Not only did they feature affordable dishes, but they were the most vegetarian friendly restaurant in a two or three mile radius. To this day they still have the best pita 'bread basket' in town--pita caramelized in butter and oil, delicious. But depending on what you order a dish can seem very fresh and tasty, or recently unfrozen and iffy. A recent meal of spinach pie provided an acceptable salad (if a little skimpy on the feta and olives) and a clearly homemade yet microwave reheated pie, causing the edges to get hard. Why would they make food fresh, then freeze and microwave it? Perhaps it saves some time, but it also ruins the food. A fellow diner ordered the vegetarian plate and enjoyed the selection. And the potato 'chops' are still unique and worth ordering. But these kinds of cut corners should be saved for fast food, especially with the restaurant's recent rise in average price-per-dish. Still worth visiting but much less reliable than in the past."

Bike the Drive is the event, ""excuse"", the adults use for the weekend but the tradition of all the side adventures is the real deal. The night before the ride we start at the Hop Leaf and always finish at Simon's. John, the longstanding bartender, does his best to keep us out of trouble in between his Neil Diamond doppelgänger music gigs. Whether it is bouncing us, and more specifically our drinks, off the newly designed back patio, or comping us pitchers of retro Schlitz, or keeping the urinals full of chunk ice, John and the vibe at Simons do their best to make the next morning early bike ride a monumental challenge to start. Each year this geezer bike crew takes a bit longer to shake off the hops hits delivered initially by Hop Leaf and then finished off at Simons. While the pitchers of Schlitz are priced noticeably higher than when your grandfather and great uncles were drinking this numbing nectar, you will be hard pressed to find a better hooch deal in Andersonville. John continues to assure us that the $11 offering price is based off of last year's pricing model when the hops market was depressed and pure Schlitz water from the Cuyahoga was more plentiful!So when you arrive at Simons, and you know you will, try to stay off the back porch with beer, experience the urinals, get John's autograph and picture, tell your parents that you met Neil Diamond, and try to hunker down in the back of the bar in the dimly lit living room set up that was based off of a 1953 design from The Cottontail Ranch. One word of caution. Pay special attention to ""juke box"", many customers were getting frustrated with the difficulty they experienced to get their favorite tunes to play -- low decibel swearing was overheard as Herb Alpert, Naked Eyes, and Men Without Hats selections were being denied. However, big relief was enjoyed by most as their frustration was replaced with a stack of freshly pressed 20's were pushed thru a small horizontal slot in the juke box. This place is great! Give it a whirl and create your own lifetime of memories!"

So much of what they make is meant to be sampled by more than one person. And that's what we did.Before we even got to the main events, we dug into the appetizers, including meatballs (twice!), prosciutto-wrapped stuffed figs, baked goat cheese and buffalo mozzerella. The group, which included three cousins who hadn't been together in 10 years, passed the plates liberally and enthusiastically.But we didn't stop there. The main event included oysters, two different wood-fired pizzas and spaghetti carbonara. All were granted our stamps of approval.The rustic setting provided plenty of opportunity for conversation in our over-large booth -- we needed an over-large booth with all the food being delivered -- and our waiter always appeared at just the right time.Getting together with family has to be the highlight of a night like this, but our trip to Ombra made a great night better."

The atmosphere is unique, with tall booths and seat cushions made from recycled leather garments. It definitely makes an impression."

We also had a beet salad. It was just right. Great tastes, not greasy, but the roasted vegetables were actually in the form of a salad--but disappointing because I was hoping for roasted vegetables on a plate. The veggies were good, but not what I expected. We didn't try the pizza only because one of us needed gluten free. Glad we are here."

That's not what Ombra is about. And in Venice, so many outstanding bars with often very simple, fish based, sometimes pickled chichetti -- and perhaps that is the inspiration here. But these dishes are honest to the Midwest: lovely turkey polpette; a hearty hand rolled pasta usually found in Tuscany, pici; lightly dressed salads highlighting bitter greens; spicy mussels; chilled wood roasted vegetables. Paired with an excellent Italian focused wine menu with many moderate priced options, and a cocktail list that features hand made sours, fresh zests and juices, and you have an outstanding restaurant to catch up with friends over a glass or two, or the perfect mid week spot for a solo dinner and a book. I recommend it."

I made a reservation online several days before Saturday, but when we arrived there was no record of the reservation. The mairtre d exclaimed that I must have used one of the other online websites. They may not sync with his printed list. Do not rely on reservations made online. We were seated at the back of the restaurant next to a large, noisy party celebrating something, but it was still comfortable. My companion could watch the chef at the open cooking range station. Italian wine supported a sparkling conversation. The bottle of Prosecco was delicious, chilled properly, and the glasses were a good size for drinking and talking. The wood fired Margarita pizza with extra cheese tasted good, but part of the bottom was soggy. My prosciutto wrapped figs stuffed with cheese in balsamic dressing were tasteless. The fig stems were not removed properly. I had to pull a stem and skin out of my mouth in front of my guest to clear debris. This was not consistent with professional standards of prep, but the presentation looked good. The three scoops of ice cream for dessert were delicious, but I wished for gelato. The service was slow, but very nice when he arrived. Ombra shares its lavs with the place next door, which was also busy. Ombra has a good social energy with the right balance of see and be seen while enjoying your space. The crowd was interesting, fast and good social fun. I would return for wine and light snacks, but do not expect dazzle."
Ombra,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g35805-d2628616-Reviews-Ombra-Chicago_Illinois.html,"August 6, 2014",4,The good outweighs the bad,"We stopped to grab a quick dinner on Monday night. Originally we were going to do just small bites, but the wood fired pizza was calling my name. We decided on 1 small bite, and 1 pizza to share between two people.We ordered the stuffed zucchini flower, and the ortolano pizza ( roasted garlic, fontina, asiago, mixed greens, parmigiano, balsamic).The waiter returned a few seconds later to inform us it's buy one pizza get one free from Sunday - Thursday. Do we want another? Yeeeeeeeeeeees!!!!!I went with the piccante (spicy rapini, smoked mozzarella, pine nuts, calabrian chilli vinaigrette).First the bad - the stuffed zucchini flower for $10 consisted of 2 pieces. One was smaller than my thumb, and I have dainty hands. The other was about the size of my dainty handed thumb. Was it good? Yes. But I took the smaller of the two because I'm nice to my husband, and I honestly don't even feel it was a full bite. So we were disappointed.Now the good - the pizza is fantastic! The crust was very crisp, no soggy bottoms here. We had 2 white pizzas, so I can't vouch if the red sauce ups the ante on the soggy factor.Husband loved the ortolano, I thought it was just alright, but good on me, I got to chow down on the piccante. Yes, it's spicy, yes, it's delicious, and for the love of god, it was FREE!So I forgive them their terrible small zucchini flower bite, and congratulate them on 1. Having fantastic pizza2. Having a beautiful inviting space. Really, take a peek in the window, it's warm and lovely3. Having nice, accommodating servers4. Having a decently priced while plentiful wine list - my borgonero was SO good5. Being my new go to pizza place"

Has potential.","My friend and I thought we would try something new and check out Bar Ombra, which looked pretty freaking cool from their website. The interior did not disappoint - spacious leath booths, Italian newspapers lining the walls, and dim sexy lighting. The place does ooze ""cool."" When my friend came, we ordered drinks - I had a glass of wine and she ordered a cocktail, which resulted in a comedy of errors. First we were each brought a glass of red wine - then the server quickly realized those were for another table. Then we were each brought a glass of white wine - but my friend ordered a cocktail. The waiter had misheard the name of her cocktail as the name of a type of wine. Then he came back and brought her a cocktail but it was the WRONG COCKTAIL. Finally the right one came out. If you're counting, that's four tries. Wowza.We ordered tomato and caramelized onion foccacia, smoked whitefish deviled eggs, penne caprese, and skirt steak over farro salad. It should be noted that all of the ""cold apps"" do not come fresh from the kitchen, they are made en masse and sit behind the counter against the wall, like a deli. You can go up and look at them and decide what you want. This isn't a complaint, but I figure it's worth knowing.First the bread - this was pretty excellent. We each got a nice piece, the bread was very fresh and the onions were truly caramelized and added such a deep flavor to the bread. The eggs were next - these came from the deli counter. They were tasty, but nothing particularly inspiring. The smoked whitefish reminded me of Jewish deli lunches! A nice flavor, well made, fresh eggs, but didn't really seem to fit the theme. The pasta caprese was beyond pedestrian. Boxed pasta, a few tomatoes and mozzarella balls and basil leaves thrown in, finito. No flavor on the pasta, nothing was sticking to it at all. Barely salt and pepper....I mean I can throw together pasta caprese at home way better than this. Don't even bother. The skirt steak, however, was a pleasant surprise. Juicy meat and yummy salad with farro and corn. The entrees here are affordable and relatively small, so the whole menu lends itself very well to sharing.I have a really mixed impression of Bar Ombra. The bread and the steak were great, the eggs were good but not special, the pasta was lackluster. The wine and cocktails were lovely, the service was slow and confused. The ambiance was really pleasant and beautiful. It's just inconsistent. If they worked out a few snags and got rid of (or touched up) some dishes, they could really be on to something here."

It's a nice alternative to Spanish tapas bars. We sat at the bar and it was neat to see all the cold and room temp items at the case. Made it easier to decide what to order. We had the spicy cabbage, pesciolini, meatballs, and a few other things, all of which we liked. Nothing especially gourmet, but it was all good.

Highlights of the meal included the salami and cheese platter, the grilled, stewed octopus, the shrimp crespelle, and the caramelized onion focaccia. The desserts were fantastic as well: chocolate ""salami"", authentic tiramisu, and especially the chocolate ""Fantasy"" which was the best melted chocolate I have ever had, served with biscotti, and fresh and dried fruit to dip. Thankfully our server brought us extra goodies to dip because we wanted every drop of the chocolate. He also treated us to some Limoncello to sip after dessert. We left very satisfied and happy. "

Some stellar dishes and ample fun choices. Arancini, stuffed figs wrapped in prosciutto, apples with walnut and percorino, a nice selection of salumi and cheeses, good solid wine list.

The weather was balmy and humid, and guests were coveting some of the last summery weather to enjoy al fresco dining on what appeared to be re-purposed public school pews, separated by ivy-covered trellises. By then most patrons had finished up their desserts and were on their way home. We chose to sit on the bar stools that buttressed the outer wall of the restaurant. The restaurant had pivoted its small bar onto sidewalk in very novel way. This was a first in Chicago and make for interesting pedestrian interactions. We faced other patrons who occupied seats on the inside portion of this bi-directional bar, who helped us get acquainted with the menu. We were served by a long-time employee of the establishment...and he gave us red-carpet, VIP, treatment throughout our meal. He explained ever dish with vivid detail and let us sample 5 wines until we found ones to our liking. We ordered the following small plates called Cicchetti:-spicy slow cooked calamari, kale, tomato-apples, yogurt, mint-fregola, grilled shrimp, calabrian chilis, scallion-cous cous, cured salmon, olives, radishes, cucumbers-beet salad, watercress, gorgonzola, walnuts -stuffed eggs, spinach, pickled peppers, lemon aioli -cured and raw salmon...and pared these very nicely with these Italian wines:-gavi, farina 2011 (white, dry, lush, balanced, burnished brushstroke flavor with zero oakiness)-primitivo, rocca dei mori, puglia, 2008 (red, soft, medium-bodied, uses a cousin of the zinfandel grape, wild berry overtones in the finish)For the evaluation of the food, I'm going to employ a set of culinary categories that one can use to compare one restaurant to another, since most use this site to just that. I'll use a scale of 1 - 5 with 1 being terrible and 5 being superb. This rating covers and summarizes all the dishes above:Freshness: 4Visual composition (presentation & color): 4Texture and Balance : 4Flavor : 3.5Overall, the best dish was the stuffed eggs and the worst the calamari. The cured salmon was a bit too salty for my liking. Ombra makes for great, economical, casual dining between friends and is ideal for a first date. If you can get the outdoor seats, then bring your kids along. The atmosphere is jovial, the noise level was supportive of meaningful dinnertime banter, and the service attentive and speedy. That said, I recommend going on a weekday night."

The Wild-West meets Recycling Plant decor just doesn't go well with the idea of Venetian bar food. Besides the aesthetics, those benches are the most uncomfortable seats I've experienced since the Music Box theatre. Our waiter seemed inexperienced and was definitely not familiar with the menu. When questioned if the pancetta was smoked he responded yes when in fact it wasn't. If you don't know, just say so. The menu looked really interesting and the items we chose were ok but do not merit the exorbinant prices. The chichetti menu items were small portions as expected but the other menu items were miniature sized at maximum price. The Ombra benedict is a couple of tiny bites for 9 dollars. Maybe if the place were more comfortable, the portions larger and the service was better I would have tolerated it better. Sorry, but I won't be back."
