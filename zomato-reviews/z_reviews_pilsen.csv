Dusek's Board & Beer,https://www.zomato.com/chicago/duseks-pilsen/reviews,"Feb 09, 2018",4,We've heard about Portillo's for a long time but had never been. It definitely lived up to the stories. The hot dogs were GREAT. The cake shake was wonderfully decadent and the atmosphere and ordering system fit the food perfectly. They serve a lot of people all of the time and they have it down to a science. Some one or more than one person put a lot of thought into how to keep the quality up and keep the food a flowing.,Preetham Naga,39065903,33473734,DINING

Fast table clearing/ high turnover  Because you pre-pay you can leave when you want   What I didn't love:  The ""cake shake"" - a bit gross.

Dusek's Board & Beer,https://www.zomato.com/chicago/duseks-pilsen/reviews,"May 19, 2016",2,"My friends and I were thoroughly unimpressed with our dining experience at Dusek’s Board and Beer on the 17th of May, 2016. I flew into Chicago from Cambridge to celebrate my best friend’s birthday with his family and partner. We hoped to go out for a nice meal. Having been recently promoted to a one-star Michelin restaurant, we were excited to secure the reservation. In hindsight, we should have gone elsewhere. A truly dismal experience from the reservation process through payment.   Service Awkward staff with a knack for oversight on details. I spoke with the reservationist and informed her of the birthday celebration. She said she would send out a dessert. This never arrived, nor did any mention of the birthday.   We also indicated we were going to be sharing all dishes, and at numerous times throughout the meal, we found ourselves with too few plates. Towards the end of the meal, our server left one plate with no cutlery at the table—our party size was 5.  Our server knocked over the sauce for the Mussels and it splashed onto my glass and the table below. No attempt at cleaning up the mess was made, only an unintelligible squawk escaped our server’s mouth.   Later in the evening, out server knocked my water glass over causing water to spill onto my lap. At least this time he was apologetic.   Food By far the worst one-star Michelin experience I have had of the 10 Michelin-star restaurants at which I have dined. The food wasn’t bad, per se, but it was significantly subpar to the Michelin standard. Gilt Bar and Girl and the Goat which only have Bib Gourmand status blow Dusek’s food quality out of the water.",Bradley Tran,34545803,27111228,DINING

Honky Tonk BBQ,https://www.zomato.com/chicago/honky-tonk-bbq-pilsen/reviews,"Nov 06, 2015",2.5,"Sadly, this Southern boy was somewhat disappointed in the barbecue, but the side dishes and craft cocktails certainly kept us all entertained.  We were immediately seated in the upper dining hall, complete with mismatched tables, a potpourri of chairs and flea market quality art work that highlighted the homey atmosphere. The smell of smoke permeated the room, which signaled high hopes for the ‘cue - but first, a sampling of craft cocktails.  I ordered up the Honky Old Fashioned, featuring a massive pour of Makers, some orange slices, a cinnamon-spiced cherry, bitters and a splash of club soda ($8). The wife had the Bacon Candy & Brew, a plank-like portion of brown sugar-encrusted bacon teetering over a pint of frosty Old Style beer ($6). The super-simple Lonely Presbyterian ($6) stole the show with Old Crow whisky, spicy ginger ale and bitters.  The menu is pretty simple: an selection of sandwiches featuring pulled “Championship pork” ($9), beef brisket ($9.50) and smoked chicken ($8), or platters of the same proteins, ranging from $14 -$33, adding a hot link and a side dish or two. There was a token, albeit very tasty, portobello mushroom sandwich ($8) topped with collard greens - add tangy goat cheese for an additional two bucks. Their appetizers included fried green tomatoes (At 5:30pm we were told, “Sorry, we just ran out”), cake-like corn bread muffins ($5) and, being Pilsen, a cheese and shitake mushroom filled empanada ($8). Following the meats and veg, a smattering of desserts included banana pudding and peach cobbler from $6-$7.  --Full disclosure – as my profile states, I’m a transplanted Southern boy, raised 40+ years on pork barbecue, Carolina collards and Momma’s ‘nanna pudding. So, like a true North Carolina pig pickin’, this might get a bit sloppy.--  Upon arrival, my beef brisket Delux Platter ($16) sent off as many mixed signals as the restaurant’s décor – despite no visible smoke ring on the large mound of meat, the two top pieces were perfectly succulent and tender, glistening with just a touch of grease, and sprinkled with a dash of paprika-tinted rub. Unfortunately, the meat tucked below the trophy peak of goodness was gray and lifeless, impossible to tug apart and void of any discernible flavor, good or bad. What happened? How can you go from “hero-to-zero” on one plate?   The brisket on the sandwich our friend ordered looked much nicer, and was, enviously, more juicy and equally portioned.  Unfortunately, not even the barbecue sauces could revive my monotone beef; an obvious homage to the great state of South Carolina, the mustard-based sauce was tangy with a hint of honey, white vinegar and a queer note of raw garlic. The two ketchup-based sauces, while bottled differently and described by the waitress as “one hot, one not”, tasted almost identical. The best I could tell, the larger squeeze bottle was a tad sweeter, maybe from a dollop of molasses (?) - the other bottle featured more vinegar and maybe a pinch of red pepper.   The side dishes were also a conundrum – both bowls of macaroni and cheese ($3.5 for a four ounce portion) were ice cold on the top, yet steaming hot on the bottom. I not sure what linear shift in the space-time continuum causes such a temperature inversion, but it made for a lively discussion at our table. As for taste, the béchamel cheese sauce was flour-y and bland – they’d probably do better to simply offer up the nuclear-orange kid’s favorite, boxed Kraft Mac & Cheese. While the candied yams appeared to be from a can, the fresh cabbage coleslaw ($6.50 for the large portion) had a definite tang and crispness – very nicely done.  The side dish of collard greens, however, brought the meal to a complete halt. The green’s “pot liquor” had a distinct taste of tobacco – or “bong water”- as one person described at our table. And before you call shenanigans, kindly note that a famous roadside barbecue joint down in Andersonville, S.C. swore that a lone leaf of flue-cured tobacco in a pot of greens makes up for harvesting the head of collards before the first frost. I’m not saying Honky Tonk’s collards are lovingly seasoned with tobacco, but it made for an intriguing, if not unique, taste experience. My only suggestion would be to cut or tear the collards up a little more before service – one diner pulled out a leaf the size of a paper plate at a nearby table.  While the meat on the pulled pork sandwich featured a noticeable smoke ring, the wood flavors and seasonings were very subtle. Adding a little coleslaw really punched up the flavors, making the offering reminiscent of Eastern North Carolina’s classic whole hog barbecue. The veggie sandwich, a massive tower of perfectly cooked portobello mushrooms and greens, was one of the table’s favorites, but the dense, day-old bread roll was impenetrable and simply left in the basket.  Other than having to flag down our waitress for a second round of drinks, the service was unremarkable. Even with a full house, our food was delivered in less than 20 minutes, our waters were kept topped off and the dirty utensils and half-eaten plates of barbecue were cleared without comment. While I’ll probably not get the wife to return, I’d like to come back and give this joint another try – just to make sure it simply wasn’t an off night for the pit master.",Just Jamie,21394720,25429766,DINING

Let me start of by saying I don’t really rate/ review any dine in restaurants but this one is definitely one I wanted to do a review on . My husband and I went to this place with our 3 kids .First , this place has  a reduced  menu , which forced customers to only choose from limited dishes . Second , the food is not that great and ridiculously overpriced. We bought a $60 Arrachera “parrillada”  expecting to be well served with beans , guacamole , and rice  because of the price but instead we were served a plate with chewy , dry meat and no sides .Given the price you would expect a lot more . I know at least at Magueyes this would definitely be worth it . At least at Magueyes a plate this expensive would have sides, shrimp , and cheese. Additionally, we were charged $112 for the steak parrillada  and 6 horchatas ( yeah it doesn’t add up ) our total bill was $137 because according to the waiter he needed to charge a 20% tip .  I don’t mind paying but when it’s worth it and this was definitely not worth it .The service was also horrible . We had to ask for salsa and the waiter not once asked if we needed something.I will never come back to this place .

Sure, I'd heard about it many times yet never entered, put off my the long lines I usually saw while passing by. Timing our visit to coincide with a deep chill of a single digit January Sunday did little to abate the ravenous crowd waiting to take home bags of chopped pork. Even on a very cold day, the line still took us about 20 minutes to snake through as we waited to get a table and a Sunday dinner spread of Mexican soul food, but it was well worth it to taste rich, authentic pork for a pittance. I also had a nice chat with a fellow in line who enthusiastically recommended the carnitas, and helpfully informed that there were in fact two lines, one for takeout (longer) and one for dine-in (a bit shorter).

Hony Tonk BBQ,https://www.zomato.com/chicago/honky-tonk-bbq-pilsen/reviews,"Nov 06, 2015",2.5,"Sadly, this Southern boy was somewhat disappointed in the barbecue, but the side dishes and craft cocktails certainly kept us all entertained.  We were immediately seated in the upper dining hall, complete with mismatched tables, a potpourri of chairs and flea market quality art work that highlighted the homey atmosphere. The smell of smoke permeated the room, which signaled high hopes for the ‘cue - but first, a sampling of craft cocktails.  I ordered up the Honky Old Fashioned, featuring a massive pour of Makers, some orange slices, a cinnamon-spiced cherry, bitters and a splash of club soda ($8). The wife had the Bacon Candy & Brew, a plank-like portion of brown sugar-encrusted bacon teetering over a pint of frosty Old Style beer ($6). The super-simple Lonely Presbyterian ($6) stole the show with Old Crow whisky, spicy ginger ale and bitters.  The menu is pretty simple: an selection of sandwiches featuring pulled “Championship pork” ($9), beef brisket ($9.50) and smoked chicken ($8), or platters of the same proteins, ranging from $14 -$33, adding a hot link and a side dish or two. There was a token, albeit very tasty, portobello mushroom sandwich ($8) topped with collard greens - add tangy goat cheese for an additional two bucks. Their appetizers included fried green tomatoes (At 5:30pm we were told, “Sorry, we just ran out”), cake-like corn bread muffins ($5) and, being Pilsen, a cheese and shitake mushroom filled empanada ($8). Following the meats and veg, a smattering of desserts included banana pudding and peach cobbler from $6-$7.  --Full disclosure – as my profile states, I’m a transplanted Southern boy, raised 40+ years on pork barbecue, Carolina collards and Momma’s ‘nanna pudding. So, like a true North Carolina pig pickin’, this might get a bit sloppy.--  Upon arrival, my beef brisket Delux Platter ($16) sent off as many mixed signals as the restaurant’s décor – despite no visible smoke ring on the large mound of meat, the two top pieces were perfectly succulent and tender, glistening with just a touch of grease, and sprinkled with a dash of paprika-tinted rub. Unfortunately, the meat tucked below the trophy peak of goodness was gray and lifeless, impossible to tug apart and void of any discernible flavor, good or bad. What happened? How can you go from “hero-to-zero” on one plate?   The brisket on the sandwich our friend ordered looked much nicer, and was, enviously, more juicy and equally portioned.  Unfortunately, not even the barbecue sauces could revive my monotone beef; an obvious homage to the great state of South Carolina, the mustard-based sauce was tangy with a hint of honey, white vinegar and a queer note of raw garlic. The two ketchup-based sauces, while bottled differently and described by the waitress as “one hot, one not”, tasted almost identical. The best I could tell, the larger squeeze bottle was a tad sweeter, maybe from a dollop of molasses (?) - the other bottle featured more vinegar and maybe a pinch of red pepper.   The side dishes were also a conundrum – both bowls of macaroni and cheese ($3.5 for a four ounce portion) were ice cold on the top, yet steaming hot on the bottom. I not sure what linear shift in the space-time continuum causes such a temperature inversion, but it made for a lively discussion at our table. As for taste, the béchamel cheese sauce was flour-y and bland – they’d probably do better to simply offer up the nuclear-orange kid’s favorite, boxed Kraft Mac & Cheese. While the candied yams appeared to be from a can, the fresh cabbage coleslaw ($6.50 for the large portion) had a definite tang and crispness – very nicely done.  The side dish of collard greens, however, brought the meal to a complete halt. The green’s “pot liquor” had a distinct taste of tobacco – or “bong water”- as one person described at our table. And before you call shenanigans, kindly note that a famous roadside barbecue joint down in Andersonville, S.C. swore that a lone leaf of flue-cured tobacco in a pot of greens makes up for harvesting the head of collards before the first frost. I’m not saying Honky Tonk’s collards are lovingly seasoned with tobacco, but it made for an intriguing, if not unique, taste experience. My only suggestion would be to cut or tear the collards up a little more before service – one diner pulled out a leaf the size of a paper plate at a nearby table.  While the meat on the pulled pork sandwich featured a noticeable smoke ring, the wood flavors and seasonings were very subtle. Adding a little coleslaw really punched up the flavors, making the offering reminiscent of Eastern North Carolina’s classic whole hog barbecue. The veggie sandwich, a massive tower of perfectly cooked portobello mushrooms and greens, was one of the table’s favorites, but the dense, day-old bread roll was impenetrable and simply left in the basket.  Other than having to flag down our waitress for a second round of drinks, the service was unremarkable. Even with a full house, our food was delivered in less than 20 minutes, our waters were kept topped off and the dirty utensils and half-eaten plates of barbecue were cleared without comment. While I’ll probably not get the wife to return, I’d like to come back and give this joint another try – just to make sure it simply wasn’t an off night for the pit master.",Just Jamie,21394720,25429766,DINING

The waitresses are rude, they will get and attitude and yell if you give them a 10 or 20% tip. Don't bother asking for the Manager, she is even worse. When we complained about the waitress to the manager she told us that we were wrong not her and if we don't want to tip 10 or 20% not to come back to the restaurant.",Very Angry,21970161,16118809,DINING

Honky Tonk is a real BBQ place, with real people, really great food and really fun music!! Reminds me of being back home where the food is made fresh and the hosts and the guests are like family and friends. We tried the Sampler Platter because that gave us a taste of just about everything meat. Even though we were stuffed, the desserts were definitely not to be missed. The art will really keep you entertained. I have yet to see so many interesting folk art pieces in one place. When we were there, there was also great live music. By the end of the night, we made new friends and have a new favorite place to take our old friends.",Jennifer Bacon,21146420,16118794,DINING
Hony Tonk BBQ,https://www.zomato.com/chicago/honky-tonk-bbq-pilsen/reviews,"Nov 09, 2009",4.5,"Great Place. I went to Honky Tonk the other night for dinner - and this is now my favorite BBQ spot in the Chicagoland area. The inside is cozy, and the two guys playing a low-key blues/bluegrass type music made the ambiance great. The owners are very nice and they are expanding to have a whole front room/entrance/bar as well. I didn't realize they were a BYOB, but that is changing come mid-Dec with the new entrance/bar. I believe live music is Thurs-Sat. Overall the food was great - moist chicken, tasty ribs/pork/brisket, awesome sausage. The platter is the way to go unless you really want something specific. If you're going for high-end southern cusine (like Table 52) - this isn't your place.... But if you want a place to wear jeans to, get your hands dirty enjoying some great food, and just chill - then this is it. Will definitely be back.",Traveler,20932168,16118791,DINING

La Vaca Margarita Bar,https://www.zomato.com/chicago/la-vaca-margarita-bar-pilsen/reviews,"Jul 10, 2019",1,"The manager Joe was extremely rude. Although the party ordered all at the same time, the food came out 35 plus minutes apart. While some of the party waited to receive their food, the remaining party, whose food had been served, waited idly as their food got cold.   I requested to see the manager to explain the issue with service, and he (joe) proceeded to argue with me regarding the delay and how long we actually waited to receive our food. He also walked away mid conversation.      I come to La Vaca  often-- at least twice monthly-- and the service has been on a steady decline. In addition, the waitstaff did not buss the table in a timely manner. I won't return and am contacting the better business bureau regarding my complaint and manager joe's cavalier attitude.",Sheridan Tucker,126131461,43937341,DINING
La Vaca Margarita Bar,https://www.zomato.com/chicago/la-vaca-margarita-bar-pilsen/reviews,"Nov 03, 2015",4.5,"One word is applicable for describing the food: outstanding. The quesadillas came with succulent chicken that had been accented with a tasty gravy, and were served with a salad under sour cream and fresh guacamole. The flautas were also prepared with fresh ingredients and with the tortillas nicely crunchy. The chicken taco with crispy onions had a very light, savoury gravy in the recipe that yielded a flavour in a way that the tacos required no salsa with them. The arroz with frijoles and chicken under mole is a dish that I recommend highly. Any dish with a good mole sauce should never be passed and the same applies to this one. As to the beer-battered fish taco, this was yet another dream on the palate.",Gino Williams,21579640,25399073,DINING
