Calo Pizzeria Restaurant & Lounge,https://www.zomato.com/chicago/calo-ristorante-edgewater/reviews,"Aug 18, 2014",4.5,"Super-CALO-fragilisticexpialidocious!. Calo is great Italian restaurant that has become a favorite of my father's and we finally got to all have dinner there when I was in town the other night. (I can't believe it's been there since 1963 and I never knew about it!) The short summary is that I would rate my meal as one of the ten best Italian dishes I've ever had the pleasure to enjoy. Here's the details: Calo is a good sized place with a nice bar, high ceilings, muted lighting and lots of dark wood and nice food-art-photography on the walls. There was a good crowd with people of all ages, reflecting the diversity of the neighborhood. It was full and lively with conversation. Our server was a consummate pro, always right on top of everything; and I noticed that all the servers worked as a team moved with great efficiency and communication together. I started with the house salad and, because it's so rare any more, I chose the creamy garlic dressing. And it was the best creamy garlic dressing I've ever had! The salad was fresh and crisp and both my GF and I commented on how flavorful the little pieces of red pepper were in the salad. For the main dish my dad had a wedge salad that he absolutely loved. His fiance had the Farfalle con Vedura, which I tried and it was delicious. My GF had the Pasta Italiano and it too was wonderful. But personally, I think I ordered best with the Rigatoni Ala Barese which was pasta with one of the best red sauces I've ever had--just so fresh and full of flavor, along with house made Italian sausage that was fantastic and it included some pieces of chicken and asparagus. It was heavenly. The wine was also fantastic. My father made a point of noting that even though it is an Italian place, the ribs are outstanding and he's had them there many times. It was a great evening and I can't wait to go back!",Rick,16175593,16090267,DINING

Calo Pizzeria Restaurant & Lounge,https://www.zomato.com/chicago/calo-ristorante-edgewater/reviews,"Jul 07, 2011",0,"The last evening of our vacation while visiting our family in Chicago was one I won't forget. My daughter asked me where I would like to go. I told her that I would like a nice Italian Restaurant, and wanted to order Chicken Scaloppine. Well, bummer it wasn't on the menu! Our waiter, Costos, said he'd ask the chef if he could make it and came back shortly and told me he would. In the meantime we all enjoyed our starters. I ordered a salad, and it was nothing to write home about. A simple plate of iceberg lettuce, grape tomatoes and cucumber slices. Everybody else was raving about their soup. I tasted the minestrone, they ordered and had to agree that I had chosen poorly. It was delicious! Our waiter was taking very good care of us, and kept our glasses full in a very timely manner. Then the entrees started to arrive. Mine came last and was more like Chicken Cacciatori, which is a dish I hate than the Scaloppine I had envisioned. I didn't want to send it back and cause problems since the rest of the family was very happy with their dinners. However Costos, took it away after I tried one bite and said they would make it right! I had another glass of the house wine, which was quite nice enjoyed time with the family. There was plenty of bread on the table, and I had a nibble of each of their dishes.   After a short wait, Costos placed a beautifully garnished dish before me and it was perfect! Thinly sliced, lightly breaded, chicken breast in a light lemon sauce. It tasted as good as it looked. I also had a fantastic side of pasta with garlic/olive oil sauce. I did not get to finish my dinner because my 8 year old granddaughter suddenly said she felt a bit sick. That little girl had been eating every thing in site and she has a slight lactose problem. Too much cheese at one time! I went to relieve my daughter in the restroom so she could finish her dinner. The granddaughter was back to normal a few minutes later and we returned to the table. The rest of my meal had been packaged up to go. My husband ordered dessert to go as well. As we left I found out that the staff had asked a long time customer if she knew how the dish I wanted was prepared. At least I think that's what the host said. Someone in the restaurant was asked. They cared enough to get it right, and I really appreciate it. My left- overs came back on the plane to Atlanta. No problem getting them through security either. It made a marvelous lunch!  I just want to say a big ""Thank You!"" to the chef and the staff, and to Costos for taking the time to make this grandmother happy! When we return for a Christmas visit we will be dinning at Calo Ristorante again! Yes, Really!",Brenda Riley,22101916,16090249,DINING

I've come in just to watch a game at the bar and have some beers too.  They have a rotating number of craft beers to pick from and I've always been able to get a few new beers.  And if there is one thing I love, it's trying new beers.

Situated right on Clark in the cute northside neighborhood of Andersonville, Lady Gregory's is about a ten minute walk from the red line Berwyn stop. But it's totally worth it.   Hands down, the star of the menu IMO is the Cold Water Lobster Mac & Cheese. This is no ordinary mac & cheese and comes loaded with mushrooms, tomatoes, and cheese. And did I mention lobster? The lobster pieces were huge and made this $18 dish worth every penny. It also comes out in a skillet style dish and is probably enough for two normal people to share, but of course, I indulged in this decadent dish all by myself.   My husband had another comfort food favorite: the Ultimate Grilled Cheese with Bacon and a cup of tomato basil soup. The grilled cheese was a combination of gruyere, white cheddar, mozzarella, and brie cheese and came out piping hot and oozing cheesiness. Along with candied bacon, the sandwich had roasted tomato concassé and fried shallots, which helped to class it up a notch.

I've had far better at the Cleveland Airport, - 8 out of 10). Beets, truffle oil, blue cheese & chips, Bangers Mash, Sweet Potato fries were ok. I do give some credit to the manager as she was helping out at our table trying to speed our food along.

It was hopping so please get reservations if you can.    Big Jones is southern themed, specifically New Orleans I believe so you'll find a lot of the southern classics on the menu. Grits, cornbread, gumbo, etc.  They even bring out a plate of begniets after you order.  I kinda thought they didn't really add anything.  They were cold and doughy and covered in powdered sugar that got literally everywhere. It could've used some fruit I think.  Anyway, the bloody Mary was spot on, spicy too.  And the popovers we got were nice.  Light and eggy, we used all the jam it came with.    The mains we got were good but not great.  I went against my better judgement and did not get the gumbo or biscuits and gravy.  Instead, it was fried chicken on top of this heirloom oatmeal.  I enjoyed it, and you do get a huge portion. My wife tried the cornbread griddle cakes.  It kinda tasted like something you'd get at a burrito house. It ended up being pancakes covered in salsa and beans with some avocado cheese and sour cream on top. Again, kinda meh.    I love the idea of this place being a southern style restaurant and the menu has a ton of interesting things on it.

It was hopping so please get reservations if you can.    Big Jones is southern themed, specifically New Orleans I believe so you'll find a lot of the southern classics on the menu. Grits, cornbread, gumbo, etc.  They even bring out a plate of begniets after you order.  I kinda thought they didn't really add anything.  They were cold and doughy and covered in powdered sugar that got literally everywhere. It could've used some fruit I think.  Anyway, the bloody Mary was spot on, spicy too.  And the popovers we got were nice.  Light and eggy, we used all the jam it came with.    The mains we got were good but not great.  I went against my better judgement and did not get the gumbo or biscuits and gravy.  Instead, it was fried chicken on top of this heirloom oatmeal.  I enjoyed it, and you do get a huge portion. My wife tried the cornbread griddle cakes.  It kinda tasted like something you'd get at a burrito house. It ended up being pancakes covered in salsa and beans with some avocado cheese and sour cream on top. Again, kinda meh.    I love the idea of this place being a southern style restaurant and the menu has a ton of interesting things on it.

The good news...the Tequila Lime Chicken....mmmmm....perfect! Highly recommend it! It came with Mexican rice that was as good as anything you would get in a Mexican restaurant. The dish was also accompanied by a warm black bean and corn salsa that added to the explosion of flavor in the dish.

Vincent is where ethnic dining in Chicago jumped the shark.  While my Dutch onion soup made me yearn only slightly for the more ubiquitous Gallic interpretation, our companion's zaansemosterdsoep (Dutch mustard soup) was shockingly reminiscent of the grainy stuff that comes in a jar.   Our amateurish waiter (who spent most of the evening referring to two thirds of our party, one half of a gay couple and our straight female friend, as ""sweetie"") looked disgusted as he described snert, a dish that proved to exemplify culinary onomatopoeia.   When I accepted his offer to debone my whole fish, little did I know that I would be subjected to the cracking of bones and the gnashing of teeth as my dinner was destroyed before my very eyes. Luckily the dish's hyper-fragrant juniper reminded me more of something that made me vomit in college than something I might enjoy eating, so the fact that the filleting process left me with no appetite was almost inconsequential. The final service hiccup? The third of a tablemate's three-course prix fixe dinner did not appear until we asked for it.  When I learned that the disastrous La Tache was finally closing its doors, I doubted that any potential successor could be worse.

Tanoshii,https://www.zomato.com/chicago/tanoshii-sushi-edgewater/reviews,"Aug 01, 2009",2,"Sushi sham in Andersonville!!. If you're looking forward to a bespoke sushi experience that conforms to your personal marine proclivities, addictions, or phobias, you may be left wanting more. When ordering my Mike's Special, I told the waitress I liked oily flavorful fish like mackerel and shad, preferred octopus to squid, and didn't mind spice. This was met with a blank stare and an inquiry as to whether or not I liked tuna and yellowtail. Apparently, the old Chicago adage ""Give the Lady What She Wants"" is not alive and well at Tanoshii.   For dinner, our party of three ordered as many Mike's Specials. Much to our surprise, the first showed up as an appetizer, ""Fish and Chips,"" interpreted as a mushy pile of under-flavored tuna to be scooped up by fried wonton shells. While the two Mike's Specials presented as entrees were admittedly tasty, I had long soured on the restaurant due in part to our obnoxious dining companions. I don't usually judge a place by its clientele, but Tanoshii is the sort of joint where Lincoln Park Trixies and Chodes keep autographed sake cups behind the sushi bar. It wouldn't surprise me if Tanoshii has played host to a sake bomb or two over the years. The food is just fine, but the restaurant's premise and popularity is driven largely by a bizarre cult of personality and the blatant mistruth that you're getting a customized dinner when the kitchen is just sending over two or three of whatever they happen to be making that night. Andersonville's sushi scene would be none the poorer if Tanoshii moved back down Clark Street four miles or so.",Mistermary,20614166,16114048,DINING

Udon noodle soup with just vegetables is also over priced at $9. Last time we ordered this the broth was not as flavorful and had a weird tang to it.

Redemption came in the form of brunch: I had the Chicken and Waffles with Siracha honey and syrup with fried eggs and potatoes. This was the best thing I could have had today since I was craving both sweet and savory. The added spice from the Siracha kicked it up a few notches in respect to flavor. My husband finally got the Nutella S'mores Waffle, which was so decadent to look at and received multiple Oohs and Aahs from others in the restaurant.

Plus, there's the day drinking (which is not only acceptable, but also highly encouraged), the delicious food options (two of my favorites, eggs and lobster, tend to play heavily into brunch dishes), and the perfect lighting (very important for a food blogger). Thankfully, Chicago is a city that has fully embraced the brunch trend. Diana is with me on the brunch love train, so much so that we decided to form an informal brunch club (the Monthly Brunchgasm). Basically, we're on a mission to sample all the best brunches in the city and beyond! We're aiming for at least one brunch visit per month, but based on our record so far, we're averaging closer to three per month. As of now, it's just the two of us, but we're already in talks with others who want to join us; we also already have a long list of places to visit, but we're completely open to suggestions! For our inaugural Bruchgasm visit, we decided to take advantage of a fantastic opportunity that came our way: a visit to the newest location of Kanela Breakfast Club . In the former The Savoy space, the fourth Kanela location offers all of its signature dishes right in the heart of Wicker Park. As with all of their locations, Kanela is focused on offering Greek-influenced, locally-sourced and organic breakfast, brunch, and lunch options... needless to say, they are a place that most definitely knows their way around all of the best brunchy food options!    We grabbed a seat near the windows (perfect for people-watching!) and started off our meal with Peppermint Hot Chocolate  (made with Meinl European cocoa), a steaming pot of French Press Coffee , and the famed Kanela Roll .
