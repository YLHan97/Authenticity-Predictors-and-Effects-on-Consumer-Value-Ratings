Jimmy's Red Hots,https://www.zomato.com/chicago/jimmys-red-hots-humboldt-park-garfield-park/reviews,"Jan 19, 2015",0,"The real deal!. I loved this place. It is gritty, no frill, Chicago style hot dog. Walk in, order and go. The fries are wrapped up in the same package as the hot dog and the price is excellent. This may be one of the best kept secrets to the out of town visitor. This was Chicago!",Cejenkinsjr,25447476,16100203,DINING

Over 62 years ago, my father wanted to purchase a small strip of land located on the northwest corner of Grand and Pulaski. He said that it would be the perfect place for a hotdog stand~and! he was right. Unfortunately, being a newly returned vet from WWII, he did not have the financial backing.  Jimmy's would have been called Paddy's. Either way, Jimmy's is a part of my past. I remember walking there fir hotdogs send fries after shopping on North Ave. It was also my oasis to warm-up after walking home through the blizzard of 1967! (I bought a vague of fries to get warm!)  Fond memories and happy times! (Genuine Chicago-style dog!)",Hastingsptt,24727527,16100200,DINING
