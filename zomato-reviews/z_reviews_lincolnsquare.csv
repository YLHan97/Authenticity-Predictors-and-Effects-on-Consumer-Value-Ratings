Gather,https://www.zomato.com/chicago/gather-lincoln-square/reviews,"Mar 03, 2015",0,"Elegant room, odd flavors, too loud for conversation. Gather inspires admiration for its varied seating arrangements offering a view of the kitchen, a seat at the bar or high or low seated tables. The atmosphere is mid-century elegant. i wish the food were more satisfying. My cauliflower dish and pasta dish were each  mashups of so many different textures and seasonings that there was no pause or comparison for the tastebuds. Our server said we must mix up the pasta dish on the plate to get all the sauce combined, resulting in a big plate where every bite tasted unpleasantly the same. No one asked how our food was, or I would have expressed my disappointment. On the pasta, there were Just too many bites of unidentifiably-flavored crispy, crunchy, toasted, roasted, seeded, spicy, lemony, vinegary forkfuls of stuff. Perhaps I should have ordered their roast chicken or burger, maybe next time. But the canned music and room noise were so loud that conversation was hard to hear, so people had to speak more loudly and that made it even harder to converse. Too bad. Because Gather's beautifully-designed cozy nooks and kitchen and bar seating areas are so inviting. And their service is kindly attentive. I live in the neighborhood, so I might return and order very carefully to see if I can have a more edible experience.",Fashionsandra,28043089,23429868,DINING

The hostess and wait staff are very personable, and the atmosphere is civilized. The food contains seasonal ingredients and incorporates molecular gastronomy techniques, especially gels and flowers. All the courses were good, but some were lacking in overall flavor, with individual components not adding up. The scallop, salmon and soup courses were excellent. The cheese course had a lot going on, including fennel chips and explosive fig pellets. The garlic custard was curdled with minimal shrimp flavor and the duck confit in the risotto was totally lost. The peach dessert was overwhelmed by the strawberry flavor, but had a good biscuit. Nice finish with a tiny hot chocolate.

Guy's picks are usually right on...so I dragged my friend there on a Friday night. Although there was a tiny wait to sit outside (since it was a beautiful evening) there were two seats open at the counter. It's a diner...why not! Our waiter was great. I am sorry to say I don't remember his name. But, he recommended a great wine since they didn't have Pinot Grigio. I loved the look of the place, too. Our seat at the counter gave us a great view of allll the shelves full of different cereals.  Now for the food! Although there is a menu, it is more fun to look up and read all the fish descriptions from the huge chalkboards. I was about to order the Baramundi after seeing it on the show...but, at the last second I asked the waiter what his favorite fish was and he said-""No doubt, the Sturgeon."" So, I had to go with it! He was sooooo right! It is topped with a bacon cream sauce...*drool*. Thank goodness I ordered when I did. A minute later a ""Sold out"" sign was put on the chalkboard next to the Sturgeon. My friend ordered a Shrimp Po Boy and said it was fantastic...said he should have ordered one to go as a late night snack! :) I can't wait to get back there!

Idiot in charge of seating customers was beyond rude.  We made reservations for 5:30. My son and I arrived at 5:28. In front of me, another lady was greeted saying she also had a 5:30 reservation. She was meeting a friend. The host informed her that she would be sitting at a lovely table about six inches from her left hip, but it was their policy not to seat incomplete parties. Then I told him I had a reservation for three and my husband was on the way. He said we'd be sitting at the lovely table six inches to my right as soon as he arrived. Now, because the place is about as big as your average suburban master bedroom, there is no waiting area. So she and I and my son stood in the doorway, waiting for the missing people.   Had I been seated, I could have ordered drinks -- for myself and for my husband (who was driving in from Schaumburg). After ten minutes, the host informed me that if my husband didn't arrive soon, they would have to give my table away because (as he pointed to his clip board) ""as you can see, I've got a lot of people who want to get in here.""   Even though my husband arrived shortly thereafter and we had wonderful food (I had the pan fried catfish, hubby had the scallops) served by a friendly waitress who went the extra mile to charm our 13-year-old son with samples of various breakfast cereals, I still can't get over the unnecessary rudeness.

When the entrees came out, there were mashed instead of sweet potatoes. Our server came over and we told him about it and he said that was not what we ordered. He was upset and surly but said he would get the sweet potatoes. Ten or 15 minutes went by and we had finished the entrees.

Seeing as Lincoln Square is one my of favorite neighborhoods in Chicago (I've had my eye on it as a potential spot to move to for years now!), I was excited to not only sample some Southern comfort favorites, but also to introduce Ashley (aka a Lincoln Square virgin) to the quirky/charming neighborhood. Unfortunately, the Arctic winds decided to swoop their way into the city, cutting our walking tour a bit short (as we were both woefully under dressed), but the chilly winds created the perfect backdrop to the warm and welcoming Luella's. Located just off of the main square, owner/Chef Darnell Reed's casual, counter service restaurant is a labor of love that was years in the making. The native South Sider learned to cook at the elbow of his Mississippi-born/Midwestern transplant great-grandmother Luella; after spending eighteen years in the Chicago hospitality scene (most notably as the executive chef at the Conrad Hotel), Chef Reed finally achieved his dream of opening his own restaurant. Of course, he dedicated it to the woman who taught him to love food. Armed with his great-grandmother's recipes, Chef Reed also draws his inspiration from his numerous international travels, as well as his explorations of the South; his contemporary twist on Southern cuisine showcases a combination of professional technique meets homey family dinner.

While I never had this particular type of cuisine, I had a faint idea of what to expect given the geographic location of the Central Asian nation and its history.  First, I expected there to be a lot of meat given that most nomadic peoples rely on high energy meals focusing primarily on protein and dairy.  Second, I found out that Jibek Jolu means “Silk Road” in Kyrgyz, so there were bound be plenty of dishes that combined the influences of Chinese, Indian, and Western cooking.  Finally, given that Kyrgyzstan was a former Soviet republic, there would be lots of Russian dishes, and Janice’s friend’s husband is Russian, so we had our cultural “in” if we needed anything.  When we walked up, it was funny to see all of the cabs parked out front due to the high number of Central Asian cabdrivers in Chicago.  We walked in, and the place was jammed for dinner.   We were quickly seated by the friendly staff, and I perused the menu options.  I wasn’t surprised with the amount of mea",Mark Anthony,23665682,23645097,DINING

Because I would most certainly win that bet.  Who really knows much if anything about Kyrgyz food, unless they hail from the former Soviet Union… And even then it can be a stretch. However, it just so happens that I have experienced Kyrgyz cuisine first hand as a child. Imagine my excitement and utter impatience when I found out there is a Kyrgyz woman in Chicago, making hand pulled noodles from scratch. Anora Khudayberdeva is the chef of a tiny North Side storefront called Jibek Jolu, that proudly serves Central Asian food. Roughly translated it means Silk Road, referring to the trade route that once wound its way through Central Asia, tiny landlocked country of Kyrgyzstan included. As soon as I found out about this place, I literally COULD NOT wait to eat there. Kyrgyz cuisine, influenced by both Asia and Eastern Europe, is robustly flavored and comforting at the same time. Garlic, fresh herbs (dill and cilantro), and spices perfume most dishes. And Jibek Jolu doesn’t disappoint.  It took me all of four days to get dinner plans together, and boy, was I hungry. My companions teased me about my eagerness to order every single item on the menu. And believe me, left to my own devices I would have. Throughout the evening our Russian speaking server gently offered that I could always come back another time to try the rest of the menu. So, let’s talk food… Kyrgyz cuisine is centered around meat and vegetables. Not much seafood, when you are a landlocked Central Asian country. But trust me, here you wouldn’t miss the fish. We started with Korean carrot salad, spicy shredded carrots with garlic and cilantro. Sounds simple, and it is. But this $4 salad is so delicious and savory, that I asked for two more orders to go. Then came the dumplings. We got two kinds. Manty, stuffed with beef onions and pumpkin, were extraordinary: large and pillowy, like a Central Asian style raviolo. The Siberian style pelmeni were smaller, stuffed with beef and onions, and served with sour cream. Both were devoured in mere moments. We also tried the famous lagman (noodles) and some borsh (beet soup), both excellent. We had to stop, because all of us were getting so full… But I am now anxious to go back for pirojki (hand pies), samsy (oven-baked pies) and chebureki (fried lamb pies). I want to try plov (famous rice dish) and kotlety (Russian style meatballs). And I most definitely have to experience beshbarmak, sheep’s head stew… Who is with me?! This is a Gourmet adventure at its best! Eaten with hands, beshbarmak needs to be pre-ordered and is as much a ritual as it is a meal.  For days after my Kyrgyz adventure, I hoarded Korean carrot salad, rationing it to make it last. I was nostalgic and exhilarated all at the same time. I am looking forward to dining at Jibek Jolu again, and soon. And I can honestly encourage you to do the same. After all, you can have your own Central Asian adventure without leaving the city!  {This review was originally published on October 11th, 2013}",Gourmet Rambler,27887829,23554618,DINING

We had manty (a kind of loose meat pastry), plov (a pilaf dish with lamb and vegetables), and beef kotlety. Everything was authentic and delicious. The noodles were especially tasty.   My only complaint is that the food is Americanized. There was no camel's milk, mare's milk, or horsemeat on the menu. It sounds scary but it's delicious.   This is NOT a good place to eat if you're vegetarian or have celiac disease (you'll pretty much be drinking a Coke while your friends are in gluten-based heaven). Kyrgyzstan is a Muslim country so the food is probably Halal but you'll want to check first.  Enjoy!",R.hill2,21526532,16170322,DINING

This is a constant with all locations. You have to wait for your food and it can seem like an eternity, even when it's a mild line.

It is currently an endangered language in the Netherlands, but it once was spoken throughout the North Sea’s southern coast. Not only does it have a once distinguished past, but it currently holds the position of one of most closely related languages to English, more so than German.  Some are quite clear cognates like “help” which is just the same word or “My name is…” is “Myn namme is …” in Frisian or “I’m from…” is “Ik kom fan …”.  However, don’t expect to be able to completely understand them.  While linguistic facts, Dutch ones included, are always interesting, I’m here to talk about a Dutch pancake house in Chicago that is homey and filled with delicious breakfast treats.  I’m talking about the Famous Dutch Pancake House/Pannekoeken Huis in Lincoln Square on the north side of Chicago.",Mark Anthony,23665682,23886717,DINING

Himmel's,https://www.zomato.com/chicago/himmels-lincoln-square/reviews,"Oct 21, 2013",4.5,"Wonderful neighborhood spot. When friends told me about a new German/Italian restaurant in the Lincoln Square neighborhood, I must admit that I was a little skeptical. I figured the restaurant was facing an identity crisis, but after having dinner there recently I realized I couldn't be more wrong.   We came in on a Saturday with a group of 4. It was pretty crowded so I would suggest to make a reservation on a weekend night. The hostess invited us to sit at the bar until our table was ready. We each had a drink and both bartenders were extremely friendly and attentive. After our table was ready we sat down and our sever was prompt to our table to greet us. Mind you that the restaurant was full, but you couldn't tell by our server as she was extremely patient with our table as I had a lot of questions about the German/Italian menu.   Our table started with a couple appetizers. We had an antipasto platter that was full of assorted vegetables and meats and also a Pear and Gorgonzola salad. Both were absolutely delicious and not too filling although the portion was very generous. For my entree I had the Bavarian Pork shank which I have not stopped talking about for the last week and a half. It was a huge piece of meat that was cooked to perfection, crunchy on the outside and moist and juicy on the inside. It was accompanied with dumplings in gravy and asparagus. My date went the Italian route and had a spaghetti carbonara which she claimed was the best she ever had. One of our friends got a pizza topped with arugula, prosciutto and tomatoes and looked absolutely delicious and our other friend got a Rainbow Trout that was a special for the night and he couldn't stop raving about it.   I know I'm rambling now, but I absolutely recommend this hidden gem. Wonderful food great service and very moderately priced for the portion and quality of food.

The waitress was nice enough, but we saw her three times and she brought the check and asked us if we wanted boxes the third time. It was sunday and the restaurant was half full. We weren't finished eating yet!  The food was mediocre at best. I love mexican food and have visited restaurants all over the country. Garcia's family recipes must not include any spices. It was so bland I thought maybe my taste buds were numb. They gave large portions except I did not want to eat my fajitas. Also, the fajitas literally came with baby size tortillas and only 5 of them. The size of the tortillas did give our party a good laugh. We stopped laughing when the bus boy actually cleared our table and drinks after we told him not to because we were still drinking what we had ordered. We thought maybe we had been taking up the table too long but looked at the time and realized we had only been there, including waiting for service, just one hour! They were pushing us out of our table but the restaurant was half full on this Sunday evening. I don't know if it is the tax in Chicago or what but I thought our bill was NOT reasonable at all for common mexican food that tasted bland and boring.

A dinner there in the Fall of 2014 left us baffled why this place was beloved. Nothing then was horrible, but neither service nor food were worth the bother. This time, we waited 30 minutes for any service despite arriving on time for our reservation. No drink orders were taken until I flagged down the waiter. Five small half slices of (bland) bread for a table of four. No drink order were refilled. The water glasses were refilled. The waiter refused to divide the bill for the four couples. ""I can't do that"" repeated four times. Once the entrees appeared, no one ever inquired if we needed anything or if anything was amiss. The manager was no where to be seen as were preparing to leave. The place was soon packed and a waiter bumped into my chair at least 5 times. The noise level by the end of the meal was unbearable. My pasta (linguini) was awash in liquid and seriously over spiced (peppery). Without saying anything, at least two others picked at their entrees. We skipped dessert and got out as quickly as possible. The others in our party said nothing in front of our hosts, of course but another guest let me know that he thought the service was horrible and the food seriously overpriced. We were celebrating an important occasion and the restaurant turned out to be a terrible choice. No matter who invites us, no matter what occasion, I would never bother with this place again.

But the chef came out angry-- and told me that I was wrong and that no one has ever complained about the food ever. Now I'm not a dumb person-- if you own a restaurant someone has complained about the food at some point. He said ""You will pay"" and I laughed and said ""I will pay-- but you must know your food sucked."" To which he quickly and cutely said-- I don't listen to people with that vocabulary. That made me giggle. I wasn't at my most eloquent-- but pay $70 for a meal you didn't eat and the eloquent flies right out the window. I will say that at one point after he looked at my husband and told him to 'stop me.' I looked at him and said 'from speaking?"" and he said 'yes'.

We have lived in the neighborhood all our lives and knew about Cafe Pizza Arte from passing it on the street. We decided it was time to try it. With great anticipation of a good meal, we went in. I ordered the Pizza Arte Lasagna and my husband ordered the Greek Salad. The salad was great. I was unable to eat the Lasagna since I had no napkin or silverware. After finally getting these essential items, I ate the Lasagna. I should have refused the silverware. The Lasagna was mediocre at best. Served with a ""cream"" cheese topping of some sort which was cold, it was uninspired and just wrong in terms of taste and texture. We each ordered our own pizzas, I ordered the Siciliana and my husband ordered the Quattro Fromagio. The pizza dough had the texture of matzoh - it was crispy and had the taste of the bread of affliction. The meat on the Siciliana tasted like it just came off a campfire....smokey and totally wrong for a pizza with a southern Italian name. A frozen D'igiorno pizza would have been a hundred times better. The Quattro Fromagio was globular and also mediocre at best.  When the meal was done, and the server asked if I wanted to take home 3/4 of what was left on my plate and when I refused, nobody seemed to even notice that this pizza was going in the garbage! A quality restaurant would have inquired why so much of their food was going in the garbage but not here. There was no sense of quality or concern for customers. All in all it was not a good experience and we will not be going back. If you want authentic Italian pizza, go to Pizza D.O.C. a few blocks away on Lawrence Ave. There is no comparison and you will definitely enjoy this place and take home every morsel you can't finish.",Traderjeff1,21956606,16108417,DINING

I may eat here again but NEVER will I bring a large group again but to quote their Sunday manager ""I don't care if you ever return"" and ""we lose money on big groups like yours"" and ""large parties waste too much table space and spend too little money."" The third to last line on their menu, which I never read before, has ""Parties of 10 or more will be charged a fifteen percent cover."" This is not a mandatory gratuity, it is a surcharge on the cost of your food. Does the money go to your hard-working waiter? No. You are expected to tip the waiter in addition to the surcharge. They let you know not even when they present the bill (it's not itemized as ""a cover"") but when they think the tip insufficient. Should they let you know when you make reservations (which they ask you to re-confirm the same day)? Or if you wander in with a big group? You have to read all the way through the menu (flipping it over) and even then, would most people think ""a cover"" is a way of saying ""mandatory gratuity?""

Sarajevo is the name of the capital of Bosnia-Herzegovina.  It is an ancient and diverse city that once boasted of being the only European city with a synagogue, Orthodox Catholic, mosque, and Catholic Church in the same neighborhood.  However, much of the city was destroyed by Serbian forces in the siege during the War of Independence from Yugoslavia in the mid 1990s.  Once the guns fell silent, the rebuilding process began, and now it’s back to its former glory.  Due to the aforementioned violence, many Bosnian and Serbian refugees came to Chicago for a better life.  This brings me back to our visit to Restaurant Sarajevo.  It was quite busy around dinner time, but we also just beat the rush by going around 6 pm.  We looked over the menu and decided to try the cold appetizer plate ($10.07) since it contained two of our favorite food groups:  meat and cheese.  While we were waiting, we got a free basket of some delicious, warm, crusty bread.  It came pre-sliced in giant pieces, and the butter that came with it had a thicker consistency that was almost like cream cheese.

Aroy Thai,https://www.zomato.com/chicago/aroy-thai-lincoln-square/reviews,"Jan 13, 2016",4.5,"After seeing Aroy Thai featured on local favorite Check, Please! last weekend, we thought the coldest day of the year a perfect time to go on a field trip to Ravenswood and eat a spicy lunch.  . There's not much inside the restaurant that sets it apart from any other Thai restaurant you'll find in Chicago. A lullaby track played languidly in the background as we were shown our seats by our smiling waitress with the restaurant half full during lunchtime. Its dining room is small and seats only around 16, and diners sit in close proximity (which made me a bit self-conscious jotting down notes as I reviewed the menu for later blog publication). I noticed a couple of electric space heaters in the corner but little else, with the focus all on the food. Rightly so. Food is the name of the game for us and we don't care too much about interiors at all, so long as its comfortable.While deciding what to order, my girlfriend and I had our usual tussle about whether we'd order crab rangoon as a starter. I do not like crab rangoon. As they contain imitation crab and cream cheese, their alleged provenance of being even remotely Asian is fictitious. Where did they come from, you ask? The debate of their origin is far from settled. Some think that crab rangoon originated at Trader Vic's in San Francisco in the 1950s. To me, they are definitely the chop suey of Asian appetizers. And in my humble reckoning, they should be eaten once a year at most. But alas, my girlfriend usually wants to order them while I seek to avoid the self-loath that comes with eating any of them with an already-protruding tummy needing no further assistance from deep fried wontons. Via Google research, I have also determined that eating a set of 6 'goons contains 70% of the American Heart Association's recommended daily saturated fat intake. Dr. Shrewd says avoid.As we debated the relative merits of deep fried dough, an odor reminiscent of a turd passed into my olfactory. This stopped the conversation for a moment as we tried to determine which menu item the scent was connected to, with no avail. In a restaurant full of mystery (I imagine there is a completely separate Thai guy menu for Thai guys), there is also the mystery of which menu item smelled slightly like a poop. Please let me know if you solve it.Instead of a deep fried heart attack, I got my girlfriend to split a salad as a starter. The papaya salad with shrimp, with over 21 mentions on Yelp, seemed like a good, social media-approved entry point into authentic Northern Thai food. At first we were confused about the long green ribbons of plant matter in the salad. ""Is it cucumber,"" we wondered aloud. It wasn't, it was the papaya itself, which is described as ""young"" and having a different taste than fully-ripened fruit.This was probably one of the most unique salads I can recall trying. The taste fuses the kick of chili peppers with the brightness of citrus juice (and whole chunks of lime) with the crunch and richness of peanuts and pork rinds with chewy, uncooked green beans. Every menu item we ordered we had selected the 'medium' spiciness level (the waitress will ask you), and this was probably the hottest thing we had. Highly unusual when the salad's a fire-throwing snack eh?One thing I liked about the salad was its lack of homogeneity - some bites were spicier than others, some were dominated by the pork rind, while others were influenced by the zesty, acidic notes of lime. You definitely have to grind your molars in order to chew it up. Since eating it was a lot of work, it would be nice to pair this dish with a soup or something that doesn't compel you to labor so hard to chew for your second course. During the salad course the chef / owner came out of the kitchen, smiling and slapping me on the shoulder as I sweated, asking me ""Is that a little spicy?""",Shrewd Foodies,28118663,25986736,DINING

I tried a bite and think I might go for that next time I am feeling like vegetarian fare versus chicken.   The Cacciatore was delectable.

Officially titled Baker Miller Bakery & Dinette, a combination café and mill house from former Bang Bang Pie employees that debuted in 2014, much of the Miller’s early praise came from house-ground Grains, hand-milled Flour and Chicago’s first “Toast Bar,” while critiques of both price and inconsistency have also been commonplace.  Using online or walk-up ordering during COVID-19, staff appropriately donning PPE but inattentive-bordering-on-rude while waiting for two slices of Bread to be toasted, it was on a nearby bench that the Miller’s goods were eaten, buttered naturally-leavened Sourdough an immediate highlight thanks to both tanginess and crumb while a $3.75 Biscuit was arguably underbaked at the bottom but nonetheless enjoyable.   Trying hard not to focus on prices, David and Megan’s commitment to their craft most certainly commendable, it is hard not to raise an eyebrow at $3.50 for a two-bite Sandwich Cookie that tastes mostly like Sugar, a quarter more for double the amount of Chocolate Chips and perfectly baked Dough faring far better in terms of taste as well as value.  Also performing well with a toothsome Thumbprint Cookie, Strawberry Jam providing just enough sweetness to a blend of Nuts and Oats, those seeking a “signature” item will find it in Baker Miller’s “Doughboy,” the baked round far lighter than a Doughnut and currently dressed like Cinnamon Toast Crunch Cereal clocking in at $4.50 after tax – far better than the more expensive Blueberry Oat Muffin which finds Fruit in a clump at the center of an otherwise flavorless matrix.",Michael U.,24564296,50108212,DINING

We stopped laughing when the bus boy actually cleared our table and drinks after we told him not to because we were still drinking what we had ordered. We thought maybe we had been taking up the table too long but looked at the time and realized we had only been there, including waiting for service, just one hour!

I have no idea what the food tastes like but I can offer my opinion that their service is horrible.   I placed an order 2 hours ago. When I placed the order, I was told to expect delivery in 40 minutes. After waiting for 50 minutes, I called the restaurant. A woman answered. She said the driver left 10 minutes ago and I should expect my food in a few minutes. After waiting another 20 minutes (over an hour after I placed the order), I called back again. I spoke to a man. He said that the delivery guy just left 10 minutes ago and he should be there any minute. He claimed he had no idea who I spoke with during my earlier call and he had no way of contacting the delivery person and giving me a more accurate estimate. (Really? Ever heard of cell phones?) At an hour and 40 minutes, I called the restaurant again and asked to speak to a manager. I was told the manager was too busy to talk to me but I could leave a number and he would call me back. I insisted and was put on hold for about 20 minutes. I never did get to speak to a manager but when someone finally came back on the line, I told them to cancel the order and wished them a Happy New Year.  Obviously this business does not care about customers. Seriously. If your delivery time is 2 hours, just be honest. I wouldn't have canceled the order if they had just been up front. But lying to your customers is not a good idea. Not to mention a manager who would rather put a customer on hold for 20 minutes, hoping they'll just give up and hang up, than getting on the line to accept responsibility for the restaurant's mistake.   Bottom line, if you don't want to starve, go elsewhere. We did. Ordered sushi from Fin. It was delicious.

Great atmosphere, great beer and whiskey list, and they had a very good and delicious burger that was part of an interesting pub-style menu.  I would like to make it back at some point to try their Shepherd's pie or their tenderloin beef and stout stew at some point.
