Bryn Mawr Breakfast Club,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g35805-d8459765-Reviews-Bryn_Mawr_Breakfast_Club-Chicago_Illinois.html,"August 27, 2021",5,"An invigorating way to start a hot, summer day","For a pair of 80-year-old retirees, breakfast has become an important part of our daily routine. Especially for someone who drank only a glass of orange juice before going off to school in the 1940s and 1950s. Now breakfast has become an invigorating way to start a hot, summer day. And Bryn Mawr Breakfast Club is one of our favorite go-to destinations. Located at 3401 West Bryn Mawr Avenue in Chicago's Hollywood Park neighborhood, at Kimball, west of Kedzie, near the Northeastern Illinois University campus in the North Park community, it was opened in 2014 by owner/chef Manny Mejia, a breakfast/brunch venue serving classic fare with a twist in a snug, rustic, chic interior. Open from 7 to 3 daily, Bryn Mawr offers some traditional and conventional dishes but what stands out are the signature items that you won't find on other menus. Oh, you can order steak and eggs and two scrambled eggs with potatoes, sausage and toast and biscuits. And I always start with old fashioned oatmeal with fresh berries, dried cranberries, walnuts, brown sugar and milk. But that's where traditional ends and twist begins. My wife can't pass up the bread pudding French toast with two slices of house-made bread pudding served with orange coulis and fresh berries. I have become addicted to the sourdough stuffed French toast with Canadian bacon, scrambled eggs, arugula and asiago cheese and served with roasted potatoes. The smoked salmon plate with cream cheese and the blueberry multi-grain hotcakes and the biscuits with pork sausage gravy, scrambled eggs, sausages and roasted potato hash also are highly recommended. In fact, it's an invigorating way to start any day."

Bryn Mawr on the southwest corner to a new and a bit bigger location. It moved kitty-corner to 3348 W. Bryn Mawr Ave. - a stone's throw away (if you're in to throwing stones). It still has an eclectic decor and the menu is certainly unique with fresh takes on many familiar breakfast, brunch and lunch items. The three of us had four different things. The first was the sourdough stuffed French toast which was stuffed with Canadian bacon, scrambled eggs, arugula, and asiago cheese and served with roasted potatoes. I thought the French toast was especially tasty, though I could have done without the arugula. We also ordered the carnitas skillet which came with roasted potatoes, chihuahua cheese, pulled pork, avocado, black beans, two eggs, sour cream, mixed greens & chipotle sauce. The eggs came perfectly poached, as requested. Our third entree was on the specials menu - the rustic peasant quiche which was applewood bacon, leeks, shallots, asparagus, lorraine and gruyere cheese. For the three of us to share, we ordered the bread pudding French toast which was two slices of bread pudding served with orange coulis & fresh blue berries and strawberries. Everything was tasty. The staff was efficient, informative and friendly. The restaurant is kept very clean."

The Bryn Mawr Breakfast Club has attracted a loyal following in the Lincoln Square, Albany Park, Irving Park and North Park neighborhoods. My wife and I were reluctant to try something new so we chose Sourdough Stuffed French Toast with Canadian bacon, scrambled eggs, arugula and asiago cheese with roasted potatoes and pork sausage gravy biscuits, which consists of two biscuits, pork sausage gravy, two eggs, two sausages and roasted potato hash. They aren't traditional or conventional but they are tasty and satisfying.

We ate lunch here on a very busy Friday after a visit to our nearby optometrist. The service was very friendly and pretty attentive. The food we ate (turkey club with a great fruit cup and curry chicken salad) was very pleasant. My only gripes are that the tables are very close together so space is limited and the indoor temperature was very warm - maybe because the A/C wasn't functioning 100%.

I have to say, this place totally lived up to the hype! Went on a Thursday morning around 10:30 and had a short wait, about 10-15 minutes. The restaurant is not large and was bustling, but our server Adrian was so gracious telling us to take our time. I was undecided between the Rancheros Borrachos on the Chef's Special and the Chorizo Skillet. Adrian said they were both good, but he recommended I try the Rancheros Borrachos since it was on the specials and they frequently change them so I should get it while I had the chance. IT WAS AMAZING! Period. It comes with poached eggs and I'm always cautious about ordering them because sometimes they can be overcooked, but not this time. It even comes with two pieces of plantanos maduros (fried ripe plantains). It had the perfect amount of seasoning, no salt or hot sauce needed. My husband had the chorizo skillet. Despite devouring every morsel we decided to share the bread pudding french toast because it was described so deliciously on the menu. Again, total winner. Adrian told us that and the pancakes on the menu are also available in half orders. Attentive, knowledgeable, and helpful service. Amazing food. Decent price (my special was $12 and it was worth every penny). I will be heading back to try the lemon crab cake benedict and Mayan benedict served for brunch soon."

Overall the food was very good and unique. We saw this restaurant on Check Please and thought it looked good enough to try. The wait on a Saturday mid morning was quoted as 30 minutes and it was about 30. They seat at a first available so big parties wait a lot longer than singles and couples - which is kind of annoying but whatever. We were seated by the beverage bar. I got walked into and knocked around by every server and busser for the entire hour. It was impossible to get out of their way. It's a super small place. Our table was rocky and our water kept spilling. I was so annoyed I kept getting out of my seat to stuff paper napkins under the table leg. The staff stepped over me but no one offered to help. I'm a coffee snob and I usually expect to be underwhelmed by weak coffee in places that serve a lot of it (diners, breakfast restaurants...etc.). I thought because this place was unique and prided themselves on fusion flavors that they'd at least have some good coffee. It might have been good but their water to grounds ratio was way off and one mini-moo creamer turned it into white water. I was sorry to have paid $2.75 for a bottomless cup of hot half and half. My kids had the fresh squeezed juices and they were great. Our orders were: lemon crab cakes, peach raspberry waffles, cinnamon swirl pancakes, strawberry rhubarb pancakes, and regular pancakes with a side of fresh berries and whipped cream which we asked to be on the side. The last one came with berries and cream on top which threw our son who doesn't like his food to touch. The raspberry peach waffles was super complicated and had I read the menu more carefully I probably wouldn't have let my daughter order it. The raspberries and peaches were cooked into a compote and as fruit it was unrecognizable as a tangy red blob. The four waffle triangles had char marks on them - not sure if someone's not cleaning the waffle iron or what. Then on top of the four waffle triangles was a blob of what was described as ""chocolate mousse and almonds"". It looked more like a melted light brown whipped cream puddle. On top of the mousse were fresh sliced peaches and almond slivers were sprinkled sporadically around. The mouthfeel was strange. The compote and melted mousse made the waffles soggy and a combination tangy/sour from the compote and creamy chocolate from the mousse. It was trying to be sophisticated but totally missed the mark. My kid took one bite and was done. At $11.50 I wasn't too worried other than that now she wanted my breakfast and I was trying to avoid having to share it. I had the lemon crab cakes. What little of them I got were good. It was a lot going on and I wish I had a chance to really savor them because there was lump crab meat, a lemon hollandaise, bacon or pancetta - couldn't tell, and perfectly poached eggs. There were english muffins and breakfast potatoes and I really wanted to eat it instead of the soggy waffles but I'm a mom and that's what moms do. My husband's strawberry rhubarb pancakes were good. I never got to try the cinnamon pancakes but my other daughter gobbled them up so I'm guessing they were good. Breakfast for 5 was $90 - about $40 more than I'd prefer to spend on breakfast but we went late enough in the day that we didn't eat again until dinner so I guess it paid for itself. Coffee is a big draw for me. I don't think I'd go back because I really like to linger over coffee with my meals and this coffee was nothing to linger over. And the amazing menu sounded prettier than it actually was. I feel like if someone had been interested in helping me fix my table leg and if I'd gotten to eat my own meal I'd be writing a better review so don't not try it because of me. Maybe I just had an off experience. "

Our expectations were a bit dimmed when we saw how small the dining area was, but since we didn't have to wait for a table (unusual, we were told in advance), we decided to give the place a shot. Oh my goodness, are we glad we stayed!!! My husband had the club burger which was absolutely delicious. I had one of the specials of the day, spiced bananas covering some mascarpone filled french toast with a caramel sauce. The dish had some other delectable ingredients, but I need not go any further. The plate was completely clean by the time our server came back- the food was positively magnificent. I am going back for the ""BOP"" because it looked fantastic!

Perhaps it is due to, having heard the sterling reviews, that expectations had to outstrip reality. Perhaps it was because none of the menu items folks raved about on other reviews were available on the day we visited. I ordered one of the French toast varieties, served with mango and other fruit and some kind of cheese or cream sauce (not the crème anglaise, which is what I would have ordered, had it been available). Regardless of what sauce it came with, the French toast did not have the texture that would have made it great. It was doughy and too soft, as though it had sat on the side too long before being served. It should have had a slight exterior crisp crunch. I was left with the impression (true or not) that it was not freshly made for my order. My adult daughter ordered an egg dish, which came with quite good (again, not great) hash browns. She said the eggs were properly cooked, and she is picky about that. I forgot what else we ordered, as it obviously did not make an impression. We both had bacon: very good but not outstanding. The pluses: coffee was excellent: strong and rich. Service was attentive and quick. They were very busy and we had a slight wait (reservations are not taken), but never felt ignored. It is a quite a small restaurant, so a wait is to be expected. We were there on a weekday, around 1 pm. Our order was taken promptly and delivered in a reasonable time. The restaurant appeared clean and well maintained, including the bathrooms and the floor. Wait staff appeared content and unharried, which I always look for as a sign of how a place is run. I’d give the service a 5 and the food a 4. I’d go back, but with modified expectations."

I had a crispy root vegetable hash with a red wine reduction, perfectly poached eggs, and chicken sausage. Will try to ""reverse engineer"" this dish at home, and I hope they take that as a tribute.

Situated on Chicagos Northside this Swedish restaurant is an absolute little marvel. Cozy dining rooms and a beautiful garden seating area. We came for breakfast and ordered the sausage omelet, salmon omelet, waffles and Swedish pancakes. All very reasonablly priced and excellent portion sizes. The food was delicious. The most flavorful was the smoked salmon omelet...It had dill and a distinct saltiness to it. The tradition Falukorv sausage with Havarti omelet was much more subtle but it we also very nice. The waffle was fabulously done up. It looked so sweet I almost didn't want to try it but somehow they managed to make just the right level sweetness even with all the whip cream.Swedish pancakes are like crepes. They too were just the right level sweetness and served with lingon.... a kind of berry. All this food plus coffees cost us $65with tip. We explored the menu a bit so we expected to pay a little more. This place is a great value given the quality and uniqueness of food plus the fantastic service. We waited about 20 minutes for a table at 10am on a Saturday. Not sure if they take reservations. Street parking is available. Fee applies on Foster but apparently free on Kedzie.

It's crunchy with small chunks of nuts. Small pieces of fresh grapes add a tint of fruity sweetness.

Almost ended up at another place, but one of my friends mentioned Tre Kronor and we tossed and coin and off we went. Very cute place with friendly hosts and servers. Another couple of friends decided to meet us there and we couldn't be served without all of our party, but we were happy to go across the street to the Swedish shop and browse until they arrived. Luckily it was not a busy time and we were seated as soon as we went back in. I loved the menu of specialty sodas - so many that I had never heard of, I would have liked to try them all. I settled on a blackberry, pomegranate & ginger brew and it was very good. I cannot remember the types that two of the group ordered, but they also were very happy with their choices. I had the spinach and mushroom quiche. There was also a broccoli cheese and a salmon dill quiche at our table as well as a Swedish meatball sandwich. There were also both soup offerings ordered, the French onion and soup of the day, carrot dill. That carrot dill soup was out of this world. I really wish I had thought to ask for a container to go because it was very different and delicious - I'm unsure if I've ever seen it offered any other place I've eaten at. The portions of quiche were large and served with a beautiful mixture of fresh fruit. We decided that we couldn't decide as to which type of quiche was the best of the three. The meatballs were excellent as well. I was stuffed full after my lunch, but the rest of my group decided to order dessert - four of them - which included a lemon tart (real lemon curd and so fabulous), burnt custard (think creme brûlée, yum), rice pudding with lingonberries (served warm and oh so delicious and Swedish pancakes with lingonberries which I passed on due to the fact that I couldn't fit another bite of anything into my stomach.

The place has a homey diner fell and did have a mural of trolls on the wall to give it a Swedish feel. There were other accents within the place to represent Sweden but oddly I just felt more like a typical American diner which was not a bad thing. I had an omelette with smoked Norwegian salmon, dill and cream cheese. It was tasty but the fish was very salty. If you are on a low sodium diet, skip that. You also had a choice of toast and I chose a Swedish bread that I was not familiar with, I ended up not being very keen for it. On a positive note they offered a wide range of jams including apricot and blueberry. My friend had the Swedish pancakes with lingon berries which she enjoyed very much. Both of enjoyed the flavorful but not bitter coffee which was replenished frequently. I am not sure this would be a place I would go to often but for a change of pace or when visiting the area it was a satisfying meal. There is street parking only, no lot so that made for a bit of a hassle. I just came to accept that getting to anything in Chicago is a chore. The only real complaint I had was that the tables are very cramped and when we went it was completely full so the tables were obviously needed. If you are interested the owners also run a Swedish import place across the street which was well stocked and had many interesting items to look at and I even bought a Swedish cookbook there."

It is in the neighborhood My one star is based on the extremely bad service we had there on May 21. It seems that as Tre Kronor has gotten more popular the service keeps getting worse. Over the last year food that arrived cold when it should have been warm. Long waits after we have ordered. (then the food arriving cold). Serve staff that either need training or do not care. No matter how good the food is if you are so aggravated by the service it really does not matter. Yesterday when we arrived we were seated and given the menus. Then the server disappeared we did not even receive water. After 15 minutes and no one returning to take our order a server asked. ""Do you need something"" Then she said ""This isn't on me this I am not your server."" Another server finally came over and apologize, got us water and took our order. In an empty restaurant it took 20 minutes to get water and our order taken. Now it another 20minutes and no food (this was lunch) we had ordered 1 salad and 2 quiches. The story goes on our original server came over without so much as an apology. My 86 year old mother who loved this restaurant said no more and this type of service was a repeat of other disappointing visits. I asked the server if she had a business card with the owners name on it and she said ""Unfortunately we are out of them. Just really really progressively bad service. Chicago is full of good and great restaurants so there is no need to put up with poor service."

Being at Tre Kroner makes us feel like we're thousands of miles away. It's like taking a vacation without leaving Chicago. For breakfast, we like to get a freshly baked cinnamon roll followed by their generous portion of delectable quiche (available in a variety of flavors, it's considered by many to be the best in the city). Of course, the homemade sausage is too good to pass up, so we always order that, too.Lunch and dinner are always special, too, but breakfast is our favorite meal. Many of the wait staff are students from North Park College, located just across the street - they couldn't be nicer or more helpful. We feel like we've come to a cheerful home of a friend for breakfast - it's not just a restaurant, it's an experience you'll want to enjoy again and again.There's sometimes a wait because the restaurant is so popular. But you can always pop across the street and check out the Swedish gift store which carries everything from authentic foods to decorative glass, kitchen wares, toys, fabrics, and even clogs.The neighborhood is good for parking except possibly when classes are in session at the college. Check out the side streets around the restaurant for free parking, or find a spot on Foster where you need to pay.It's a lovely, well kept neighborhood - perfect for a walk after your meal.

But there are some places that just do a few things really well. Tre Kronor is that kind of place. I have had their french toast and it was disappointing, not at all the scrumptious treat it sounds like on the menu. Their swedish pancakes are okay, simple and served with jam. Their eggs benedict, my favorite breakfast dish, is served only on the weekends and I was not impressed. Do NOT order the one with crab cakes because these are just gross mush. The salmon ones are okay. I have had better. All of that said, their omelets are the best I have ever had. I highly recommend their salmon and cream cheese omelet, where they are generous with the salmon and the cream cheese. But whatever you do, if you are in the area, you MUST GET A CINNAMON ROLL!!! I didn't think I liked cinnamon rolls until Tre Kronor showed me how it's done. Their cinnamon rolls are enough to make you eat their breakfast 4 times in one week. The unexpected lemon icing just puts them over the top. Order them to go, and they are good at getting them out to you fast. In a panic that I would no longer have these cinnamon rolls to look forward to for breakfast, I made a mad dash for one last treat before my bus came to take me away. I will now be dreaming of that last cinnamon roll. Also, I wish other restaurants would follow their example on drink choices. They have rare finds like cucumber mint soda that I wish I could find where I live. One more thing, my fellow travelers have raved about the quiche but I never got around to trying it. Many agree that it is the best they have had. I will definitely be back here next time I'm in town to order quiche, and of course more cinnamon rolls!"

The most difficult problem is making a decision since everything is so delicious. Their eggs are fresh and such high quality. They remind me of when I was a child and we actually had a farmer come to our house and deliver 6 dozen eggs each week. (I'm one of 9 siblings so we went through a lot of eggs.) My darling loves their Kobenhavn omelette with the spinach & Danish blue cheese. I'm a big fan of the salmon quiche. We both love the coffee, probably because it is from the Coffee & Tea Exchange and is the variety we brew up at home. The maple pecan danish brings all kinds of happiness to your mouth, YUM! I like taking a large group of family & friends so we can sample tastes from each other plates. Swedish pancakes with the delightful lingon berries is a another top choice as well as their home made waffles with fresh whipped cream & fruit. Couldn't believe there was no wait at 12:30 on a Sunday! Sarah, one of our favorite waitresses, said June had been a slow month. Make a special trip if you have to but go to Tre Kronor and enjoy!"

But thee were plenty of things that they liked. The oldest niece had a hamburger, and I must admit..it looked really good. The younger one feel in love..and I mean in love, with the potato and leek soup. It was really good. She had never tasted anything like that before, being the chicken nugget child that she is. We actually got some to go in a cup and she drank another whole serving on the way home. I had the orange, vanilla and cinnamon french toast which was divine and my husband had the Stockholm omelette. THe cinnamon rolls were delicious and the sparkling lemonade was a hit.

Some friends of ours who dine there regularly told us about it and so we decided to try it for the first time to celebrate our three year anniversary. Not only was the food delicious, but the staff was warm and welcoming. To start our meal, we had fried calamari which were served hot and crispy. The calamari came with a bowl of hot marinara sauce, but we opted for fresh-squeezed lemon that came with it instead. We also ordered an order of the Caprese Salad- a perfect starter. Though, we had to stop ourselves from eating the fresh sour dough bread, extra virgin olive oil and parmesan cheese that the restaurant provides provides to every diner-we didn´t want to get full right away :) Next, my fiance´ ordered the Grilled Salmon special which was served with brussel sprouts and a side of spaghetti cooked al dente and prepared with a light oil and garlic sauce. I opted for the mushroom risotto as I am a risotto lover. It was tasty, creamy, and served at just the right temperature. A middle-aged woman with short blonde hair was our waitress (I think she was part of the family) and she was extremely attentive to us, yet gave us our space as well. She gave us plenty of suggestions as we didn´t know where to begin with such a wide selection of choices on the menu, including all the weekly specials. I ordered the tiramisu´ for dessert which is homemade- I think it was the best tiramisu´ I have ever tried. It was smooth and creamy. My fiance´on the other hand, ordered the chocolate souffle´ which was served hot....I had to steal a bite because it looked like chocolate heaven and it was. Our waitress told us that the souffle is imported from Bindi desserts in Milan Italy. To accompany our dessert, I ordered an espresso and a my fiance´ ordered cappuccino that was really well made- the milk was frothed to perfection and sprinkled with a touch of cinnamon, which reminded me of the cappuccino we had last summer in Italy...hard to find a good cappuccino around here so we appreciated it. In summary, the staff was warm and hospitable, the restaurant was cozy (especially with it´s holiday decor), the food was exquisite and the pricing was very reasonable; in fact, we feel it was a steal! Bravo, Via Veneto! We can´t wait to dine with you again!"

When it arrived, we noted there were no avocados. When we asked the waitress she said, ""Yeah, we don't have any so I told them to throw in some extra palm.""

Oh, how I've missed it! For me one of the best things is that they have a vegetarian section on their menu. I do eat fish so I have often had to special order shrimp dishes at other Vietnamese restaurants because it is not easy to find meat free dishes usually, but Hoanh Long has a good vegetarian selection to choose from. Today I had the papaya and tofu salad. So fresh, so crunchy and great flavors. I also ordered the vegetarian spring rolls and the dipping sauce is yummy. In the past I have had the vegetarian version of Pho, the crepe and a couple of the noodle dishes. Everything has been good. I have been there with meat eating friends (one of whom is Vietnamese) and they have also always enjoyed it."

The owner's, two generations now, are from Italy and they bring the magic to the food. Service is always good and a crafe of the house wine, very nice and reasonable.

Well Angelo says they don’t turn on their charcoal grill until around 9:30. I said you should have told me that I would never have ordered these burgers! I told him about the insane amounts of grease and first he says that it’s just the juice from the burger. I tell him I’ve had burgers and there is a difference between GREASE and fat/juices from the burger. Then he tries to tell me the heat from the burger in the container makes the buns squishy. I said the buns were not squishy it was when I picked up the burger it dripped a full stream of grease for several minutes. Then he starts calling me lady and little girl. He also talks over me the entire conversation when I try to speak. I point out he is talking over me and he says, “No I’m not.” Then proceeds to talk over me again and I point it out to him, he just kept talking. He says, “What do you want me to do?” I said I wanted a refund for my burgers, which I had asked for several times (while he talked over me). He says, “That’s all you had to ask for then!” Then he tells me he will write down my credit card number and refund me later then THROW OUT THE PAPER WITH MY NUMBER ON IT!!!!!!!!! I said, “You can’t throw out a credit card number in the trash!!” He says something like, “Oh just my luck with this lady today” (Or something to that effect). I am not about to have my credit card number taken from your trash (or one of your employees) and have tons of fraudulent charges from it, incredibly irresponsible.So listen:1. FALSE ADVERTISEMENT OF CHARCOAL BURGER2. INCREDIBLY RUDE AND DEMEANING MANAGER ANGELO 3. WANTS TO THROW OUT MY CREDIT CARD NUMBER IN THE TRASHAll of these things I find unacceptable. It’s fast food but I’ve never had such a horrible ordeal with ANYONE! Don’t eat here and if you do ANGELO is a nightmare."

While the eggrolls were edible, the dinner entrées - Mongolian beef, chicken cashew,shrimp pea pod, along with sweet sour pork- were all terrible tasting, so much so that we ended up throwing it all in the garbage.It was just awful! The sauces were gushy and tasteless, the chicken strips were dry, the peapods were limpy and overcooked, the covering around the pork was thick and greasy, and the pork was hard as nails.This experience was especially disappointing as some years ago we frequented this restaurant and really enjoyed the fare that was offered. Sadly, that is not the case now. Then having called the owner, Sandy, about our terrible experience, not even, “I’m sorry you experienced a bad meal, “was even offered.There are too many good restaurants out there with owners who pride themselves on providing their diners with quality food and a memorable dining experience. this is not one of them.

The restaurant was pretty full and we had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated. Once seated our server came and took our drink order. We each ordered a drink - a zombie and a mai tai. After looking at the menu, we decided on going with the full family-style dinner for two which is on the last page of the menu, as it had everything that we wanted. We started out with a cup of wonton soup, and then an appetizer platter with two crab Rangoon and two large egg rolls, along with some BBQ pork. The egg rolls were very dense and very good. Our entrees arrived - the chicken kow and the sweet & sour pork, along with the BBQ pork fried rice. Everything was delicious. At the end, we finished up with almond and fortune cookies. The total price was reasonable, especially with the two tropical cocktails. The staff was efficient and attentive. It had been some time since we were there before tonight, but I don't think we'll wait as long for the next time."

Everything we have had at this restaurant has been very good and the service is excellent. Quite a bargain, also. For example, last night we had the dinner for two. We each got won ton soup, egg roll, crab rangoon (yummy), barbecue pork for appetizers. Dinner was either chicken kow or mongolian beef and pork egg foo young, pork fried rice. Dessert was rainbow sherbet and fortune cookies. And also hot tea with our meal. All this for $20.50 for two. An unbelievable deal and of course we had leftovers to take home.

The owner can be pressed to sub the egg roll for something else!)The restaurant is an older one with atmosphere and when you enter you can easily imagine Frank Sinatra sitting down for chop suey with Sammy Davis here.Only downside are the waitresses who have been with the place forever and are a bit slow and forgetful but my friends and I have come to accept that as part of the old school charm of the place.Parking lot in front of restaurant and the quick delivery of food from the kitchen make even a working lunch possible."

They have a list of special sakes on the table, but they didn't carry several on the list. I ordered mine which came in a little wooden box (!) and was cold. I'm used to warm sake! For appetizers we had gomae (spinach) and gyoza (dumplings). The filling in the gyoza tasted rancid so we asked them to take it back and off our bill which they did. I had steak teriyaki and shrimp tempura with vegetables. The steak was cooked the way I like it, but had no flavor. It was slathered with sauce that truly tasted like it was out of a bottle. The tempura was… meh. There were two scrawny pieces of shrimp barely visible in the batter. The vegetables were ok but the batter made them seem heavy and the dipping sauce wasn't the tasty accompaniment I wanted, but seemed to be poured, again, from a bottle. Very mediocre all the way around. An interesting item on the plate appeared to be sweet potato strings.I had four pieces of California maki roll but this tasted nothing like any California roll I have ever had.

Nowhere, not on the outside of the restaurant, not on the menu, was there any indication that the food was kosher. The chorizos, traditionally a pork sausage, were not listed as ""beef chorizos,"" and the ""ribs"" were, of course, beef, though nowhere so described. Both were poor substitutes for their piggy originals. We prefer our beef rare, which is not available in a kosher restaurant because of the stricture against bloody meat. All of the beef was overdone--thin slabs, tough and fatty. In any case, we were not asked how we wanted it cooked. Had the sign outside the restaurant indicated it was kosher, we would not have gone in. Had the menu indicated ""kosher"" we would have left.

Fantastic Flavor, Poor Service, Kosher, Pricey!","My wife and I were up from Atlanta, Georgia to celebrate our son's graduation from Northwestern. I lived in Buenos Aires, Argentina for over 5 years as a teenager (back in the 1960's) and in the 50 years since have continued to visit both for business and pleasure. I love Argentine cuisine....I guess it's a comfort food for me...so my family reserved a table at Evita for Father's Day. A Google search surprisingly produced several candidate Argentine steakhouses in Chicago, and Evita was the most convenient to Evanston. Reservations were set for 8 pm on a Sunday....the restaurant apparently was open until midnight.Let me start by saying that the preparation and flavor of all of the food we had here was outstanding....beef empanadas, fresh chimichurri (a traditional Argentine condiment), steaks or ""bifes"", potato and vegetable sides...all seemed authentically Argentine and flavorful and were cooked exactly as ordered. 5 stars to the chefs.There were a few surprises....First of all, we had no idea we had booked dinner at a strictly Kosher restaurant. Let's face it....high-end Argentine restaurants are not very common in the U.S., much less Kosher Argentine? And this distinction was not obvious from our Internet search or the storefront itself or my first glance at the menu. We arrived a bit early and as I studied the very simple short menu, I was not seeing the typical beef offerings I am familiar with from Argentina....no bife de lomo (filet), or bife de chorizo (NY strip)....instead I was seeing steaks described a bit more generally as bife al vino (steak with wine reduction) or bife con papas (steak with potatoes) or bife tropical (tropical-style steak). When I inquired with one of the waiters as to cut of meat, he explained that some parts of the beef cattle were not permitted for Kosher preparation....the rear part of the cow...and that what they served was primarily a steak known as ribeye or in Spanish bife ancho or bife de costilla. Bingo! It suddenly dawned on me for the first time that we were at a Kosher steakhouse. And as I looked around at other tables, I noticed that many of the male patrons were, in fact, wearing yarmulkes. It was father's day, many families were there, and the place was very full throughout our visit.It was surprising that there were no Argentine wines on the menu...only Chilean and Spanish wines. Perhaps this had something to do with Kosher wine sources....though Argentina certainly produces Kosher wines for its very large Jewish community.There were only a couple tables available to us upon arrival. We chose the one against the front window that appeared to offer the most room. Chairs were adequate but not especially comfortable. Ambiance was quite noisy with much clatter....hardwood floors.Perhaps the food was 5-star caliber, but the service was not. Perhaps the holiday crowd strained the wait-staff resources...or someone had called in sick? But on that evening, they seemed to take a team approach to waiting on our table with no one person responsible. As a result we were served by a total of 6 or 7 different people (never the same one twice) and there was a lack of continuity in their attention to our dining experience. We were never checked-on and certainly never rushed and it seemed to get worse as the evening wore on with long waits between every phase of the meal. No one asked if the steaks were done correctly (they were), whether we wanted more bread or if we needed anything. We felt as if we were continuously ""slipping through the crack"" somehow. Everyone was cordial and apparently busy, but the integrated service just wasn't there for us.A good illustration was the final phase of our meal. We had finished our delicious, yet fairly simple, main plates of steak, vegetables and potatoes to face a lengthy wait for someone to clear the plates and discuss dessert or coffee. With help from the delightful female hostess (we were seated close to the front door), we finally flagged down a waiter to begin clearing and to discuss dessert options. We placed a dessert and coffee order but again many minutes passed with no sign of action and we reluctantly decided that it was simply too late and time to go. I got up and settled our account with the hostess in front and we quietly slipped out the front door en route back to Evanston.Total price for a party of three was $212 including a ""standard"" 18% gratuity automatically added to the bill. This was for a couple glasses of wine, a couple appetizers and three entrees....no cocktails, dessert or coffee. Though the food tasted great and was authentically Argentine, the total experience of food, service and ambiance did not meet expectations for this price point. Perhaps we experienced an off-night or a capacity problem. I believe it is a relatively new restaurant with excellent potential...they can cook! They just need to raise the bar on consistent service and ambiance."

I Finally convinced the husband to return and we were not disappointed. The ambiance was nice, not noisy, clean, and the bar area was great. I want to go back just to hang out in the big leather club chairs. The bar area has a definite cool vibe, just be advised that the drinks menu is rather small. An expanded food menu is top notch Argentinian, with a wide array of choices. If you’re not too hungry, stick to the appetizers or flatbreads, the meals are brontosaurus sized, and served on big wood platters. I would drive across town just for the empanadas. They are lightly crispy and incredibly delicious. The non-dairy ice cream dessert with some crunchy yummy baked thing underneath was just right, a great finish to a great meal. I can’t wait to go back. Be advised: there is an 18% gratuity already charged, you can adjust accordingly. Just check your bill before you generously add on an additional 20%."

We had the buffet (I hear chef's do not like buffets) & my friend told me he wasn't impressed. I was sad & embarrassed because flip food, when done right, is flavorful & delicious....This visit was one of those not so great meals. My brother & I went in for dinner. We took a look at the buffet which didn't look very appetizing. I usually like to get Pancit Palabok because my family didn't make this dish. It looked pretty pathetic. Dried up roadkill sadly to say...the rest of the food looked ok. We sat back down & asked the waitress for a menu. She told us the kitchen was closed & the buffet was the only food available. IT WAS 6:38 IN THE EVENING!!!! We chose to eat from the buffet (of course no roadkill palabok) but the rest was edible.So, in conclusion, LQ is a hit or miss.

I must admit that one of the neatest things about the decor is that the large buffet hot table is made to look like a Filipino ""Jeepney"", that you can see there or in many movies. The food is definitely interesting and I wish that it was labeled better. I have a feeling that the vast majority of the guests are Filipino, so the restaurant does not go out of its way to really identify some of the items, or whether they are considered, appetizers, entrees or desserts. I did try a number of things, most of which I could not spell, let alone pronounce, but I will say this much - if you see something that uses the word ""bitter"" - believe it. For desserts they had such things as yams and sweet rice. They also had an interesting item for dessert called a ""halo-halo"". This was definitely worth a try. It is a cold dessert with shaved iced, ice cream, milk, and a number of different tropical fruits. It was actually pretty good.

The banquet buffet came with 9 dishes, three desserts and unlimited soda. We also ordered a lechon (roast pig). I've had individually better dishes but overall the food is very tasty. Some of our guests had never had Filipino food and it was gratifying to see them coming back for seconds. The lumpia appetizer was a little overfried but still tasty. The other traditional Filipino foods like crispy pata (pork hocks), pancit bihon (rice noodles), pinakbet (vegetable stew), friend whole shrimp (head included), beef caldereta and chicken adobo were about as authentic as it gets. There was fried rice and sweet and sour fish but those are ubiquitous in Chinese and Thai restaurants. Desserts were leche flan (custard) topped with macapuno, biko (sitcky rice) and ube (yam). They were outstanding. The restaurants serves halo-halo, the king of Filipino desserts and unbeatable for a hot summer day. All in all the food was well prepared and very tasty. As for the lechon, the meat was excellent, very tender with a clean taste but the skin wasn't crispy. Filipinos like lechon skin very crispy and this is the highlight of the experience. I think the problem was that the lechon and a lot of the food was prepared ahead of time, hours before it was consumed, losing some texture in the process. All in all, getting a buffet and a private room for less than $25 (including tax and gratuity) per adult provided good value. For smaller parties, the dining room offers more dishes in its extensive buffet. One item that needs improvement is their air conditioning. Of course it has been unusually warm throughout the country but the restaurant was relying more on good old electric fans to cool their patrons.If you are a Chicago area resident or visitor and want to try authentic Filipino cuisine, Little Quiapo should be your first stop."

I found two choices and chose Little Quiapo because the website made it look so authentic, traditional. The other restaurant looked too fancy and uppity. I was a little bummed though because I found the food a bit overcooked ... my family and I didn't show up until evening, so it was possible the food was leftovers from the lunch buffet. Filipino food has very little color to begin with so doesn't always look appetizing to the unfamiliar, but I didn't even find it appetizing when looking at the buffet. The area around the food was messy; no one was going around tidying it up, so you have picked over lechon and BBQ just scattered in it's area. The lumpia was overfried, the dessert items looked like they were just thrown onto the platters that I didn't even want to touch them ... In general, the area just wasn't appealing to the eye, making me lose my appetite. We were pressed to get home, so my daughter and I both ordered halo-halo to go. We were both excited to at least enjoy our favorite filipino dessert, but were again disappointed. My daughter's halo-halo had so much of the mix in it - mainly LARGE red beans which is the least favorite of all the the halo-halo mix items - that it didn't seem to be a good balance of mix and ice. Mine BARELY had any of the halo-halo mix in it that I had to dig way to the bottom to get it, which also wasn't easy because my shaved ice was so hard that I couldn't break through with the flimsy plastic spoon provided. We ended up tossing both after about halfway. I'm hoping my experience was isolated, but at the same time I also hope the business takes notes of my review.

The restaurant itself is unpretentious but certainly welcoming and clean. We have received good service whenever we've gone. The atmosphere is relaxed and almost family-like. They offer a variety of food items that Filipinos would usually eat. Because it is an all you can eat buffet, you can sample different dishes without worrying if you will like what you ordered or not. Of course, you can eat as much or as little as you want. My problem is that I always over eat. Yes, there are a lot of fried stuff but there are stews, soups, noodles, and even vegetable dishes. On weekends, they even serve ""lechon' - a whole roast pig. The price is very reasonable, the parking ample, and the desserts varied."

As for the Pho I ordered the large Kobe Beef...Pho while my mother ordered a small Kobe Beef Pho for $2 less? The Kobe Pho was $12.95 for large while the small was $10.95. I should have taken a picture side by side to show the little difference and I felt that was a ""Rip Off"" for $2. Also was really hungry for anything. I also found it weird that the staff member did not seem to understand when I asked for change and gave me $5 more. I would think the person was smart enough to count the change since he works there otherwise the restaurant would be losing money if he does that. All in all, decent place.

The individual servings are not overly generous but just enough for one with a good appetite. I understand that for larger parties, they offer large servings to share. I think it will be hard to go wrong with whatever you order - none of the 11 dishes disappointed.

For those who want to try Filipino food or who have a craving for it, this restaurant can be strongly recommended. The place is unpretentious,decent and clean. We must have lucked out because our party of 11 was seated right away on a Sunday. Not long after we arrived, there were groups of people waiting to be seated.  The menu selection is varied so even picky eaters should be able to find something to order. Our son-in-law and daughter-in-law are both full blooded Americans but they both enjoyed the different dishes we ordered - about 11 different dishes. The individual servings are not overly generous but just enough for one with a good appetite. I understand that for larger parties, they offer large servings to share. I think it will be hard to go wrong with whatever you order - none of the 11 dishes disappointed. The Kaldereta and the adobo deserve special mention.It may be surprising to find that they automatically add the tip to your bill. In our case, given the good service we received, I did not mind at all. Overall, a very good family experience."

The inasal chicken is OK but not as great as those made in the Philippines. The batchoy which comes with your house specialty order is quite good, a little pepper and some soy sauce and your back home in the Philippines. I would also suggest the Tangigue kinilaw ( a Filipino version of Ceviche ). This just hits the spot. Prepare to wait though for your order, it will take quite a while."

We just missed the rush hour so we were seated immediately. At the suggestion of our server (who turned out to be the owner), we shared a platter: grilled chicken (the house specialty), fish, pork squid, garlic rice and batchoy soup. While I have tasted better grilled meats elsewhere, the service was quick and the staff were warm and friendly. We enjoyed our dinner outing."

Their specialty is chicken inasal which I ordered. I ordered the house specialty which comes with batchoy soup. Tried their tanigue kilawin too for appetizer. Batchoy hits the spot, I'm not crazy about eating kilawin because it always gives me an after taste every time I tried one, this one didn't, I figured the fish must be very fresh. I have tried chicken inasal back home, this one doesn't come close, it's too bland. For dessert I had the turon, love it with the chocolate inside and caramel for sauce, yum! Will try other dishes in their menu next time ."
