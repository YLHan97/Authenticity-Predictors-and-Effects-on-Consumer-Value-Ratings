Legit, no shortage of space, yet a good rustic vibe to the place, making it look like a watering hole in a quaint, smaller American town.  We had hunger syndrome so we kinda over-ordered. My SO got some pan-fried chicken and salad. I got baked beans, potato salad and a brisket sandwich.  The sandwich was filling, but a li'l too heavy. I think the chicken was much more tastier for me (if you haven't eaten brisket before, should stick to chicken unless your stomach is seasoned enough to try it)  All the same, would definitely visit again and try other things.",Dheeteater,30747088,32258714,DINING

The charcoal encrusting of the pork ribs was just splendid. The meats were just done to perfection. The sides were nothing to write home about though. Seating consists of outdoor benches and more outdoor benches indoors. It is not a place to enjoy an intimate evening. Large groups of chums will enjoy themselves most. Nice idea to have kitchen rolls on the tables. With so much meat being thrown around, there is bound to be a mess. Loud music fills the warehouse-esque decor, making it very difficult to carry out a conversation inside.

Finally on a Tuesday night we made our way to the west loop and checked it out. Tucked away down an alley across from the SoHo house and next door to Parlor Pizza, Green Street is easy to miss. That might be one of the reasons it took so long to stop by. Once you find it though, you’ll be greeted by a walk between some exposed brick and a bunch of lights on strings. Along with the brick walkway, It really gives off a barnyard, warehouse chic type look. (On a side note, I think I’ll start tacking on chic whenever I describe a style.

Opened in 2015 and a Best New Restaurant awardee the following year, time under the guidance of Tony Mantuano allowing Grueneberg access to great Ingredients but apparently never convincing her that pretense and a good view were necessary, guests entering Monteverde will immediately notice a homey feel despite see-and-be-seen layout, the waiters and waitresses all professional yet genial whether describing plates or suggesting Wine while back-servers do world-class work keeping glasses filled and making emptied dishes vanish.  Slightly varying the daytime menu from that at night, Brunch plates lining the left column with Snacks, Small Plates, Pastas and dishes “Per la Tavola” to the right it was after a discussion of serving sizes that four items were requested, a one-by-one procession begun by two styles of Grissini from which savory bested sweet while a $6 follow-up of three Zeppoles immediately made Dessert a necessity thanks to unrivaled lightness beneath Cardamom Sugar and Raspberry Jam plus plenty of warm Vanilla Cream for dipping.  Originally planning to go all-in on Pasta, those thoughts reconsidered when the waiter described “generous” portions, it was instead “#Montemadame Toast” that next found itself compared to a similar Croque-riff from The Loyalist just one day prior, both Radish and Black Pepper helping to refresh a classic but Fontina Cheese simply not as enthralling as well-made Mornay Sauce.  Next presented with Gnocchetti and instructions *not* to mix the Ingredients so flavors could stand apart it was admittedly interesting to see the variance in textures ranging from creamy to leafy before disobeying and creating something far better with a few stirs, the famous “Cacio Whey Pepe” to follow intensely saline on first bite but subsequently mellowing as heat developed in the mid-bite before permeating the sinuses.   Turning things over to Pastry Chef Sara Lamb to finish, time at The Pump Room and now Monteverde Restaurant & Pastificio making her a name to watch, it was ignoring warnings from one Staff member that two Desserts were requested, the $12 Butterscotch Ice Cream Puff manageable by one thanks to delicate Choux, Meringue and complexities created by Booze and Fruit plus Buttered Pecans that all contributed to something greater than the sum of its parts while the Warm Chocolate Ganache Tart was admittedly a dish best shared thanks to its thick Dark Chocolate that even Bananas, Caramel and Ice Cream could not make seem lighter.",Michael U.,24564296,38064815,DINING

Avec,https://www.zomato.com/chicago/avec-west-loop/reviews,"May 01, 2016",3.5,"Several years ago when I went to Avec, it had a high-end, trendy, American feel to it. I never detected anything French or Basque about it, as they advertised then. And there was a faint hint of Mediterranean. As of my most recent visit, it's still very high-end, trendy, American.  The service is top. The food is okay. Since my visit in 2008, the small plates have seemingly become entrée size. My advice would be to order linearly, not all at once if you think you may not get to enjoy a large plate because the small plates are larger than expected.  I had a shaved brussel sprouts salad that had grapes, slices apples, crunchy peas, and some flavourful cheese in a tasty vinaigrette. This came in a large bowl. The other dish I had was a huge bowl of mussels, which per the menu was a small plate. The mussels were a bit mushy and the lima beans were al dente. Having had mussels at other restaurants in a sauce accented with saffron, the sauce on the mussels at Avec made for an okay dish. And instead of toast for better sopping of the sauce, there was something akin to doughy naan. The server paired both with wine, a white for the salad and a red blend for the mussels, and both pairings were spot on.  Avec is a happening spot, so reservations are recommended. For the food, I give 2 stars. The service bumps my rating up because the servers are very good with offering suggestions.",Gino Williams,21579640,26957967,DINING

There is just one row of tables on one side and barstools on the other. Wood goes from the floor to the ceiling and it just looks really sleek and modern inside.    For the two of us we got two small plates and two large.  We probably could have gotten away with one less plate but we got great leftovers.

The foccacia is something I would drive into the city just to order for takeout if I could.  The steak was good but it wasn't special.

Avec,https://www.zomato.com/chicago/avec-west-loop/reviews,"Dec 15, 2009",2,"Most overrated restaurant in Chicago. I have to say that I used to be a huge Avec fan in the past. Undoubtably, Avec has some outstanding, very creative dishes from stictly a culinary standpoint. However, I have to say that after the last experience I had with them, I will definitely never go back.  1) Waiting approx 1+ hrs for a table is ridiculous. The food is good, but it isnt that good. There are no pre-reservations and you have to show up at the restaurant, and then make a reservation for 1+. Whoever owns this place is off their rocker full of themselves. This place is always crowded for some reason, but it wont last in the long run provided the reasons below. 2) The waitstaff are prentetious and act like they are something they are not. Very rude and inattentive! I normally always tip $20, but after the treatment I received last time I went to Avec, I actually made it a point to tip $0. I'm not sure what they are going for (NY or something), but rude and attitude do not work in Chicago, we are nice people. 3) The lighting in Avec is so bright (to try and increase its turnover and get people from staying long periods of time at the table) that I felt I was on Broadway or something. Nobody is perfect of course but I definitely dont want people to see all my wrinkles and imperfections under a makeup lamp (I'm a straight male too). 4) Packed like cattle. Tables are packed in like sardines. I personally do not want anyone ease-dropping in on my conversation (and vice versa) but at Avec, you are gonna it is guaranteed it happens. So, watch what you say otherwise the table (brushing up right next to you) is going to make fun of everything you say. 5) Food is Avec's saving grace. Excellent and creative, but for the prices, there are many other places to choose from without the rest of the poor treatment and nonsense. 6) Sum: Avec is more about making money than pleasing the customer. Very disappointing since the food is so good and the restaurant vision has so much great potential. Weighing the good food vs pricing, waitstaff, ambience does not justify a return to Avec.",Oliver Ellsworth,20652295,16086823,DINING

We were guided well by the server and ordered 4 small plates to share for the 2 of us, starting with the cauliflower & potato salad (which was like a crispy quick pickled veggie dish) and the sunchoke and shaved brussel sprout bruschetta (a surprisingly smooth puree over crunchy buttery toast). Our main course was the steak with both summer and autumn squashes and artichoke hearts, and for our ""dessert"" we had the seemingly famous stuffed dates. These were the best way to end the meal, complex for little bites with the salty bacon enveloping sweet dates, then the late heat of the chorizo. Yes, the wait was an hour and there is no waiting area per se in the restaurant itself - but there are multiple bars on the street and the hostess takes cell phone numbers, so we counted it as time for a few drinks and to check out other neighborhood places. We sat in the middle of a communal table, so another party had to get up for us to squeeze in, but this only added to our meal - we were eyeing other diners' plates and trading tips about where else they'd been as part of their supper club.

Taking a very different approach to upscale dining than Smyth, the similar price-points and semi-casual ambiance notwithstanding, it was henceforth that Sandoval’s Menu focused on precise plating and the best ingredients available, a symmetrical disc of top-flight Fish Eggs flecked in Chives and Dill Flowers exuding elegance atop silky slices of Amberjack before a 2-in-1 dish of Madai topped in Seaweed and Hokkaido Uni that was fine but in no way as exciting as Shields’ version at Smyth with Funnel Cake and Maple.  Growing bolder with another two-part dish, a freshly shucked Oyster with Ham Broth and Finger Lime tied together by Borage preceding Pork Grissini decorated in contrasting flavors as well as textures, it was exciting to learn that the next dish was making its World Premier in this very moment, arguably the best of the night as it placed Langoustine in a thick broth of Eggs and Calamansi with Citrus finding its foil in a tangle of Greens.  Carefully plating a small filet of skin-on Sea Bass next amidst Peas, Brown Butter and Fennel, the stack unfortunately falling sideways when set down by staff, it was regrettable that Fennel overwhelmed more subtle flavors as it is prone to do though the follow-up of housemade Pasta was no less heavy-handed in the case of shockingly fragrant Truffles out of Australia.  Intrigued by the back-to-back use of puffed Grains to add texture, that of Wheat amidst the Capellini not as prominent as Rice on cooked Lettuce next to a beautiful bite of Wagyu, it was here turning the evening over to Pastry Chef Courtney Kenyon that the Sidecar Cocktail was reinterpreted as Sorbet, leaves lining the bowl not particularly necessary but the flavors nonetheless doing their job to refresh the palate.  Offered Coffee at this point and opting to partake given a late night ahead it was as the Double Espresso on Ice was being prepared that another highlight was served, French Cow’s Milk Cheese puffed high as a Soufflé and given a complex finish thanks to the addition of Sesame plus Lemon rich but light as a cloud while the Pavlova recently-debuted Pavlova seemed misnamed despite tasting great, no real Meringue to speak of and the bottom technically flawed as it proved difficult to cut with just a spoon.   Finishing up with four more mouthfuls, all pleasant but none in particular adding to the narrative, it was alongside the check that a thank you and three gifts arrived, a nice touch though enough Coffee Beans for one cup is probably lost on the vast majority who aren’t running home to burr grinders while the Seeds were better-off spread nearby than in the desert they’d have traveled to in the case of this guest.",Michael U.,24564296,38124715,DINING

I say this in the same way a mother says this when she comes to terms with the fact that her body will not be how it was before she gave birth to children whom she loves. I came here the night before I left Chicago and unfortunately I was late as I had no experience of Chicago rush hour traffic - fortunately the lateness did not negatively impact my night or the quality of my meal in any way. I was greeted at the door by a lady who greeted me with a drink to warm me up and offered to take my coat before showing me to my seat. The staff were dressed in black and white and looked very professional yet stylish. The decor was lowkey with dimmed lighting,  there is no dress code which is a huge bonus for me but I must add that everyone else who was there that night came dressed in formal clothing so I felt pretty weird in my jeans and 'look I'm a tourist' beanie. The service is impeccable and there is always a waitron ready to top up your glass or take your empty plate away. None of the 16 meals that I had that night disappointed and I would be hard pressed to choose a favourite but I still struggle to get the taste of the  kampachi - nigiri with yuzu kosho and genmai (which is surprising because I am not a big fan of raw food) as well as the bone broth - vietnamese coriander, cinnamon and lemongrass out of my mind. The dinner was swift and I even got to see chef Noah as he came out to grate the truffle onto one of the means, unfortunately I wasn't aware of who he was at the time. The meal came to a close and I was given my dessert in a box as a takeaway as well as a personal printed out copy of the food and drinks I had that evening with my name and the date written on them as well as a farewell message because it was my last evening there.   Side note; the bathroom has everything a girl could need, I mean everything - even dry shampoo.   I would suggest this place to anyone and everyone who has the opportunity to go and if I find myself with the opportunity to go again I definitely will.",Nqobile Msibi,34945505,30217965,DINING

The funniest thing, the chefs weren't even Japanese. You could see a bunch of Caucasian men through the see through glass of the kitchen, but they were sending a bunch of mind blowing Japanese foods to the table. It was simply excellent!  You wouldn't find the regular teriyaki or tempura here. The dishes were all elevated type of cuisines as well as the ingredients. Otoro, chutoro at $10 a pop were dead center, and sounded expensive for one piece of nigiri sushi at $10 but oh. my. goodness... It was worth every penny. I called otoro or super fatty tuna belly the bacon of the sea. It was so exquisite and just soooooo damm good.  It was pretty cool to see items like mentaike spaghetti and uni cawan mushi. That spaghetti was explosion of flavor and I was deliriously in love with a pasta dish at a Japanese restaurant. Cawan mushi was a savory egg custard, and it was made super smooth in texture with this smokiness of charred uni that also gave the intense flavor of the sea and paired with these roes that popped in your mouth. Wow!   Every single thing we got was excellent. The unagi don was a hit as well as the sea bream. The sea bream.... Just get it! All the desserts were also surprisingly well made and tasty. The matcha parfait was my fave.   Okay, I'm running out of vocabulary and I couldn't come up with another synonym for ""excellent"" without becoming redundant. It's just an extraordinary sushi place with a decor that supposedly mimicking Mad Men for the Japanese. The theme was Tokyo Business Men hang out in the 1950's. The place was modern looking however, and was filled with great energy even at 9/10 pm at night in starting supper. It was not cheap. Get ready to shell it out. We were just here for late night light supper and the total check for five of us were $400.

Picollo Sogno,https://www.zomato.com/chicago/piccolo-sogno-river-west/reviews,"Jun 19, 2011",2,"A DISAPPOINTMENT. We looked forward to our lunch at Piccolo Sogno following our son's NWU graduation for a few weeks before coming to Chicago. We had tried for dinner reservations but were told that there was a waiting list for cancellations, and not only a waiting list but a megalist--80 folks were ahead of us on that list. What a fabulous experience this lunch was going to be! (Eighty perople would never be content to wait in Cleveland.). We kept our 2:30 reservations on time and were, of course, wowed by the patio. It is Piccolo Sogno's finest point. From there both service and cuisine slid rapidly downhill. When we asked several questions and one of our party was a bit indecisive after two of us had ordered, our waiter rather bruskly clipped. ""then, I'll be back."" Ten minutes later, we were required to call him back to complete the order. We began our lunch with appetizers--the calamari fitti, squash blossoms and some sort of fresh mozzarella in proscuitto. All three were disappointing--the calamari tender, but not sweet (not the baby calamari the we are used to at Luxe and the Wild Mango in Cleveland), too many tentacles and a bit too salty, the blossoms rathy skimpy and bland and the prosciutto and mozarella, simply uninteresting. Insalata mistas were then served--mixed greens surrounded by three halved grape tomatoes (the skins of mine wrinkled, a sign of waning freshness)--the dressing was a bit on the acidic side--fine for me but my husband could not finish his. The greens were very fresh but the salads most uninteresting--they would be better dubbed ""greens with tomato."" Main courses were again a dissappointment. My husband settled for just having the lentil soup which he said was quite good. I had the green and white noodles with veal ragu--the noodles were wonderful and cooked perfectly al dente but the ragu was thick and heavy and seasoned with a bit too much rosemary (a spice that is best used sapringly with meat dishes--appropriate with a veal ragu but it would not be my choice). Our son was disappointed with his triangular pasta which he commented was overly seasoned with leek and garlic. Our daughter's margareta pizza was tasty but the crust appeared to be a pita or other type flatbread--another disappointement for such a well reviewed restuarant (dare I mention"" Piece"" where pizza is more than king!)--hers was soogy in center causing difficulty cutting. We skipped dessert, took a quick trip to the restroom and left feeling quite glad that we had settled on lunch and not waited thorough the list of 80. I have long believed that the quality of a restuarant can be judged by the ambience of the restrooms. Piccolo Sogno certainly fails in this regard. The ladies room is no match for the patio--it appears to have been overlooked in the gentrification of this site. I'm sorry that the ""dream"" did not come true for our family.

Picollo Sogno,https://www.zomato.com/chicago/piccolo-sogno-river-west/reviews,"Sep 09, 2009",0,"""Little Dream"" Come True. This weekend, I had the tremendous pleasure of hosting my awesome, Italian through-and-through best friend in this glorious, food-filled city. Since I can't go more than a few days without indulging in Chicago's culinary offerings, I took the liberty of planning her entire trip around eating. And, since she is a fabulous friend, she willingly entertained my need to nosh over doing super touristy things like visiting the John Hancock and Sears (yes, SEARS) Tower.  Friday night, accompanied by one of my favorite chefs of all time (my mom), we visited the acclaimed Piccolo Sogno (464 N. Halsted). Piccolo's buzzworthy patio has dominated every dining publication since the restaurant opened in July 2008, so when the hostess offered us the opportunity to experience the Tuscan escape first hand, no 60 degree evening could stand in my way. Despite my reading and research, I was hardly prepared for the breathtaking oasis of greenery and soft lighting that awaited us.   Completely distracted by the beautiful ambiance of the patio, it took me a good five minutes to even glance at the menu. Our phenomenal server, Jeff, greeted us and quickly proved that his expertise was enough to guide us through our dining adventure- no map (menu) needed. To start, Jeff recommended the antipasto appetizer, a divine collection of wood grilled vegetables (complimented perfectly by the homemade, aged balsamic vinaigrette), house cured meats, and the best Pecorino Romano cheese this side of the Atlantic.   Our appetites whet for more deliciousness, Jeff demanded (seriously, we had no choice) that we sample an appetizer-sized portion of the legendary Ravioli ""Piccolo Sogno"", an exquisite four cheese ravioli served in a butter Marsala glaze with pine nuts and fresh Parmesan shavings. The pasta was sublime, cooked to a perfect al dente. Normally not a fan of Marsala sauce, I was perplexed by the intensity of Executive Chef Tony Priolo's masterpiece. Honestly, I wanted to get a straw and slurp it off the plate, but decided to save my companions the embarrassment by dipping delicious rosemary foccacia bread in it instead (a practice we refer to as ""dinge-ing"" in my family).  To cleanse our palettes, we ordered the Insalata di Pesche (Peaches) and the Insalata special for the evening- shaved artichoke over a bed of baby arugula, dressed in a heavenly lemon oil. It's difficult to imagine that a salad could be so damn good, and consequently we spent the rest of the weekend dissecting the flavors in hopes that my Jersey-Italian BFF could recreate this incredible dish at home (we think we have it figured out!).   After having already sampled so many wonderful dishes, we seriously contemplated our ability (and need, really) to eat dinner. Using my perpetual justification that my brother/roommate could enjoy any leftovers, we dove head first into the entree section of the menu, taking Jeff's spot-on recommendation to order appetizer servings of the Pasta and Risotto specials and the dinner portion of the Veal special. And they were exactly that- special. The pasta, infused with truffles, could have been overpowering and potent, but instead was silky and gratifying. Similarly, the veal was juicy and breaded, the large cut served simply without the distractions of a sauce or glaze. After sampling those two dishes, I barely had room to enjoy my perfectly cooked, incredibly rich vegetable Risotto.

Ending the meal – and this trip to Chicago – on a high note, unsolicited advice from the server again spot-on, it was passing up Shaved Ice and Donuts that two Puddings were presented, the “Almond Tofu” essentially Panna Cotta with a savory slant and textural elements while its competition truly was cloud-like in its support for what is essentially Tres Leches Cake flanked by Tropical Fruit.",Michael U.,24564296,38271717,DINING

The food and service are always amazing which is why we always go and always recommend it to others.  Where did my old Carnivale go!?!?  We had reservations this past Sunday night at 9. When we got out of the cab, the valet told us that the kitchen was closed and only the bar was open. The hostess then said that was wrong she sat us right away.  The server came by shortly thereafter and instead of taking our drink orders, she said that if we would be patient and wait a few more minutes, we would then have her undivided attention. This proved far from true.  When she did finally return, she told us that they were out of all the seafood entrees and that they were also running tight on a couple of others that we were considering.  She then came back and told us that yes, they were out of two of the four entrees we wanted to order.  We then ordered the meat and cheese appetizer. The order came out without the meat. We were almost done with the cheese by the time someone came by so we could tell them we were missing the meat. We were told sorry, and then they came back with beets! Not the meat!   We eventually got the meat part of the meat and cheese platter and the entrees came shortly after.  Two of the four entrees were cold. I sent mine back and my friend took a couple bites out of his cold entree and said he just didn't want to deal with this fiasco anymore and said no, don't reheat.  We also ordered two extra sides and they brought two of the same.  Bear in mind that all this was going on while our server was still performing her disappearing act which made the lengthy wait with wrong food even worse.  We were eventually asked if we wanted dessert and we said no. We wanted the check so we could end this fiasco of a dining service.  Instead of the check, they brought us a couple of desserts and said that they were on the house. They also took around 10% off of the check.  I'm sorry to say this but, free desserts and 10% off do not make up for myself, my wife and the other couple giving Carnivale part of our greatest asset. Something we will never get back-Our Time!

Carnivale,https://www.zomato.com/chicago/carnivale-west-loop/reviews,"Oct 21, 2010",4.5,"Fun, hip, exciting!. My boyfriend took me to Carnivale for my birthday, and what a wonderful choice he made. While waiting for our reservation (we were early) we stopped by the bar and I ordered the ""famous"" mojito. The bartender crushed the mint right in front of us and then poured the drink. It tasted divine. Our reservation was called (before our reservation time), we walked into the main dining room, and I was blown away. The entire room was 4 stories high with these huge lantern-like lampshades of color bursting out from the ceiling.  We started off with guacamole, which was okay. I've had better guacamole other places, and Carnivale has much more interesting appetizers to try. We also ordered the Manchego cheese plate, which came with flatbread, almonds, and honey. The cheese was so good! Very pungent and flavorful. It mixed well with the honey and almonds too. I only wish they gave us a bigger slice of cheese. We ordered the ropa vieja, at the server's suggestion, and it was delicious. The braised beef was very tender and flavorful, the plantains were sweet but not overpowering, and the spicy mayo and queso fresco added just enough seasoning to make the dish perfect. Very generous in the portions too (5 big pieces) and we ate them all!  For entrees we ordered a shrimp ceviche, which came in a spicy orange sauce and apples. It was not the highlight of the night, and neither my boyfriend nor I cared much for it, but we have never had ceviche before and perhaps it just isn't our type of dish. We also ordered the braised short rib, which was to die for! It came with polenta and cashews, in some sort of flavorful sauce. The short rib was so tender that it flaked off with a fork. It was delicious! For dessert the waitress brought the birthday dish of the night, spice cake with chopped pineapple on top along with a scoop of cheesecake ice cream! So good because it was not very sweet, yet still savory, but next time I want to try the dessert the couple next to us got, a pineapple split! It was half of a pineapple covered with 3 types of ice creams, almond slices, chocolate sauce, whip cream, and cherries.  Overall the dinner was amazing. The service was excellent and Liz, our waitress, was very knowledgeable on the dishes and gave great suggestions. She also spent the perfect amount of time checking to see if we needed anything and giving us time to ourselves to enjoy our dinner. Carnivale is definitely a great place to take someone for an exciting and fun birthday. It is a feast for the senses!

He's not some chef jerk who always wants to be on TV though he won James Beard's outstanding chef award. We went to the same college as well so gotta love that. I met and talked to him a couple of times and he's nice guy. I just didn't care for Blackbird a whole lot. However, I really do love his other restaurants -  Avec and The Publican. Love hate.. It is going towards love currently.  I have been to Publican before but I never wrote a review. This last time, we were looking for midnight snacks after getting hammered at The Aviary. Walking down Fulton Market with my drunk friends, we decided to park ourselves for a little bit more at The Publican. I love The Publican compared to BB and Avec because I really didn't feel claustrophobic in there. Ha, Paul.. Finally invested in square footage? I love that I didn't have to eat elbows to you know what with the diners next to me and hearing about his botched colonoscopy. It was fanfreakingtastic. I could still see the communal tables setting are still present but when I dined there, it was fine. They also have these enclosed box booths that are way the opposite of communal as they're super private. I wanted to try that but we had five people and the box only fits four.  The Publican is known for quality meats, and serves many things that the Publican Quality Meats store next door sells. I was too full and a bit drunk to micromanage the ordering and my friend, the birthday boy, seemed to be into seafood tonight. I should have blurted out I wanted some ham, like the fermin serrano. However, what came were dozens of amazing oysters, a plate of fried cheese curds with sausage and fried oysters, shrimp ceviche, and a Tsu Kiji crudo sampler platter. Everything was tasting really good though I myself was rather full from Aviary's pork rinds. I was too sleepy too and all I wanted was coffee.  When my coffee came, it was the best coffee ever - my fave Intelligentsia. It came in a french press and the coffee aroma permeated through my nostrils and hit every bud of my smell sensory and it made me really happy. It was so strong and good that my friend on the other end of the table smelled it too and asked for a cup. The coffee was thick with fresh ground beans, so strong and so hot and I had wished I was talking about a man! It was one of the best things I could possibly drink after five or six cocktails earlier that night. I am not a big drinker so the cocktail tasting menu got the best of me. I didn't order six drinks on purpose. Well, I take it back. I kinda did.  Our server was a sweetheart. He sent us compliment from the chef of fried cauliflowers that were deeeeelicious. He was also so very patient with one of the most drunk friends I had at the table. It was pretty comical and he was not in the least pissy though we were an obnoxious table and the last table that prevented them from closing. He was superb and was well endowed with tip at the end.  Yes, so for now, it is love for One Off and Paul Kahan. I always love my Chicago restaurants and it is still the city with one of the best eats. Each time I am in town, I lose one word from my vocabulary - HUNGRY.  Hungry? What's that?!",Lu,31405942,25162255,DINING
The Publican,https://www.zomato.com/chicago/the-publican-west-loop/reviews,"Oct 01, 2015",4,"I prefer weekday brunch to the dinner menu here. Go to Publican on a Sunday during brunch hours. Order the sourdough pancake. This thing was insane. The sourdough obviously meant the cake itself wasn't sweet. It was stuffed with bacon wrapped chicken thigh and breakfast sausage... inside the pancake. Stuffed. Inside. It was cooked and served in a hot skillet. Then they gave us this bourbon maple syrup that when poured into the skillet, it sizzled and then caramelized. Oh my god. It was divine. Top that meal off with a side of bacon which is $7, and you know why? because it's really like 3 slabs of pork belly. Thick and heavenly. Eaten with a little of the extra syrup because why not? The bloody Marys were also good because they were served with a beer back. Then you can also get oysters. At brunch! That's what I'm talkin' about.",Erin Thor,32025791,25092378,DINING

Chef Kahan's a compatriot of vaunted Philly chef Marc Vetri, likely rooted from being in the 1999 James Beard Award Best New Chef class. Kahan has a veritable Chicago empire with the lauded Black Bird, Avec, Publican Quality Meats, and of course, the Publican, just to name a few. The fact that other well-established chefs are using PQM meats for their menu speaks volumes; clearly the Kahan family's dedication to quality butchery and charcuterie is on point.",J Kim,23438702,25083460,DINING

The basic theme is kind of a hybrid of family style/small plates and we were encouraged to order about two items a piece to satisfy all appetites.  Prices probably a little steep to justify the portion size but with a packed house it obviously wasn't a deterrent for people.  The food was excellent!  Ordered a ham platter with three different types, a smoked salmon dish (maybe the best I've ever had) and a tuna dish along with two plates of vegetables (tomatoes and beets, both excellent).  Every dish was enjoyed by all.  The only slight disappointment were the pickles which had a place of prominence on the menu that led you to believe they were some sort of house specialty.  They weren't bad at all, just nothing terribly special or original.  This felt to me to be a great place to take a small group for the sharing aspect, but there were also many couples there for the evening as well so I don't think you can go wrong either way.  This is a really good place with an obvious following and I'd encourage people to check it out!",Rob Leydon,29302051,24600337,DINING
The Publican,https://www.zomato.com/chicago/the-publican-west-loop/reviews,"Jul 06, 2015",3.5,"Stopped by for lunch to take back to work. Went with the White Rabbit salad and the Ribollita soup. A little pricey. Not super take out friendly. Estimate on the soup and salad was about ~10 minutes but was told it would likely be faster. Only took them about 3 minutes.  Soup smells amazing. It's runner beans, cotechino, country bread and braised kale. Soup had a really unique taste I haven't experienced before. Taste is growing on me. The cotechino must be finely ground because I'm having trouble seeing it. The combination of that and the kale must be contributing to the unique taste. Enjoyed the discovery but not my favorite. I'm sure it will grow on me.  Salad is OK. Again, very unique. The dressing is ready but bordering almost on too tangy/bitter. Keeping an open mind but didn't seem to be my thing.  I think it was the seasoning on the chicken.    Got chicken with the salad. Spinach, romaine hearts, peas and snap peas. Looks great fit take away.  Service was nice.

The restaurant masterfully seats people at the communal tables in a way that doesn’t make it feel like you are brunching with a bunch of strangers. Charles and I were given seats beside each other on a corner. I do this weird thing at brunch and order at least 2, sometimes 3 beverages. I always need hot tea, and a mimosa in addition to water, which is just what I did on Saturday. Then we ordered the Brioche French Toast with Mascarpone and Raspberry, and the Pimento Cheese Toast topped with over easy eggs. We also ordered a side of the maple braised bacon, which is legendary in Chicago and for good reason. The pimento cheese toast was topped with pickles, watercress, and two over easy eggs. Charles loved that this breakfast involved pickles, while I thought they were a bit overpowering. I had the brioche french toast, which was a huge portion. I thought it was quite good, but I could have used a bit more of the mascarpone sauce. The bacon was my favorite part of the meal.

The Publican,https://www.zomato.com/chicago/the-publican-west-loop/reviews,"Oct 15, 2014",0,"One more sausage!!!. One More Sausage?  We came in from Canada for a long weekend & had excitedly booked reservations in advance for our last night in town as the reviews & menu pointed to a great date night out. We sat at the bar and the service was good - the oyster shucker, our server, and the assistants to the servers worked their butts off, but the food was very disappointing. The oysters were great (but it IS hard to mess those up), the Razor Clams, which arrived cold (not even room temp) were awful. We aren't sure a) how long they had been sitting there & b) how they made the pass? Possibly the chef was too busy looking at his phone? We advised the server and he returned the dish for us without issue, but we opted not to re-order. Then came the Brussels sprouts salad for $12. Raw shaved Brussels sprouts with cheese and a few bacon bits. I had to look at the price again because I had a hard time figuring out how a salad the size of my palm with these simple ingredients could cost that much. We let it slide and waited for our Boudin blanc. I know that well-raised meat costs & I know that making sausages takes time (I make my own) but I am not sure how ONE sausage on a bed of (what seemed like an entire) sauteed onion with some grainy mustard could be $18. I actually felt insulted by that dish. The sausage itself was close to a standard Bratwurst.    We had such high hopes & left very disappointed. The dishes we had were average at best. Not sure how you can charge that much for what is being served.  Hipster lighting hit I guess.",LJP,22675943,16121842,DINING

The Publican is well known in the Beer garden sense with it's huge selection of brews. For me, the big draw is the ham. How astounding is it to be out, sampling unusual beers, and being able to eat a big ham sampler along with your frosted mug of ....some hard to pronounce beer!  What really intrigues me about this place, besides that it's a good hang out are 2 unique design features: #1 the handy round leaning tables on which to enjoy your ham and beer. They include a hook for your purse and a shelf for a sweater or anything else you are toting about. #2 The restroom set up. Engineering genius.

Housed in a 19th century print shop since 2007, restaurateur Emmanuel Nony smartly recruiting Executive Chef Andrew Zimmerman in 2009 and since earning accolades from the French tire guide, JBF and Jean Banchet Awards, diners visiting Sepia in the era of Covid-19 will begin their evening with checked temperatures followed by city-mandates necessitating masks be worn any time staff approach the table with fresh serviceware or even a refill of Water.  Undeniably inconvenient, QR Code menus another anomaly amidst this temporary “new normal,” it is largely thanks to the room’s grand appearance and gracious service that an air of refinement is retained, though the greatest part of Sepia’s appeal remains attributable to Chef Zimmerman and CDC Kyle Cottle’s Food.  Best classified as “Contemporary American,” though oftentimes globally influenced and focused on seasonal Produce, dinner began with an amuse of lemony Cucamelons amidst modernist textures, a breath of freshness quickly gone and followed by the first of two “Parker Rolls” that were nothing like the Boston namesake but nonetheless buttery and delicious.  A complimentary duo in terms of influence, Zimmerman’s training at the French Culinary Institute and time at NoMI visible in finessed flavors while Cottle’s tenure with Achatz is evidenced by manipulated textures that act to enhance rather than just “show off,” Foie Gras Mousse comes curved at $15 supplement, and eaten left-to-right explores Liver’s ability to magnify everything from earthy Sunchoke Chips to dried Shiso and juicy Cherries.  Adding another $16 for a second plate from course two, Corn Agnolotti with Pickled Blueberries and popped Sorghum suspiciously similar to Marc Vetri’s dish at Osteria Fiorella just one week prior, suffice it to say that although good it in no way compared to Chawanmushi that reminisces of Quenelles de Brochet with a velvety mouthfeel and generous amounts of Lobster.

Sepia,https://www.zomato.com/chicago/sepia-west-loop/reviews,"Apr 30, 2015",5,"Very few things in life can be called timeless. Any Chanel suit. “Casablanca”. New York City. Pearls. What else you got? And when it comes to restaurant world hardly anything has staying power. Trends come in rapid succession: ingredients, themes, fads, fusions. Some are more successful than others. But which one will we remember ten years from now? Chances are none of them. Here in Chicago there is always a new restaurant opening up just around the corner. It’s hard to keep up. But when asked what Chicago dining establishment is “a true classic” one name came to my mind immediately: Sepia.  Sepia, my friends, is flawless, and there is nothing anyone can say to convince me otherwise. From the moment I enter through its heavy wooden doors till the moment valet hails me a cab, the time stands still. Muted hues, dimmed lights, hushed atmosphere. I half expect to see Grace Kelly sipping a cocktail at the bar, making eyes at Cary Grant across the lounge. Flawless, I am telling you, just flawless.  On my recent visit I was pleased to discover that my timeless classic is just as lovely as I remember. Cocktails are vibrant and sexy, wine list curated by one of my favorite sommeliers Arthur Hon is lengthy and full of surprises. And the food, the glorious food, crafted by expert hand of Chef Andrew Zimmerman, does not disappoint. As I entertained a group of serious world traveling gourmands, who make it their business to dine at Michelin-star restaurants wherever they go, I was not even worried. Not a bit. Not even a smidgeon. Sepia is flawless, I am telling you.  A little bubbly toast as a welcome gift? Yes, please! Thank you, gracious Sepia! Amuse of translucently thin Wagyu beef to whet out appetites? Don’t mind if we do! We indulged in house-made charcuterie board, with chicken liver mousse so silky, it practically disappeared in mere seconds. Braised rabbit came generously topped with paper thin slices of fresh black truffle. Crispy crust of the sweetbreads yielded to creamy mild interior with every bite. And those were just the appetizers!  Tea smoked duck arrived looking rosy and juicy, accompanied by lovely turnips and delicious jus in lieu of sauce. Is there anything better than duck with its own jus? The answer is no. My Arctic char with chanterelles, walnuts and chicken skin chip, was nothing short of spectacular, fish so succulent it literally melted in my mouth. Think that’s just an expression? Not at Sepia. You ought to try it for yourself.  As our meal progressed, flavors building with every bite and every sip, we were looked after and pampered by the immaculately courteous and doting staff that was always there when we needed them, yet somehow managed to be all but invisible. Every detail was taken care of with precision and professionalism. These folks love what they do, and it shows.  As our evening came to a close over an array of desserts I am ill-equipped to describe (I have no sweet tooth at all, so I opted for coffee), I looked around the table with confidence only a dinner hosted at Sepia can provide. Yes, a classic, I thought to myself. Timeless and beautiful in every way.  Flawless.  {This review was originally published on October 17th, 2013}",Gourmet Rambler,27887829,23554565,DINING

Sepia is a fine dining restaurant helmed by an Iron Chef winner and James Beard nominee. You don’t go to a fine dining restaurant for a meal, you go for a dining experience, and my night at Sepia was a very memorable experience. The restaurant is housed in an old 1890 print shop, and is decorated with a mix of modern at art nouveaux furniture. It is a beautiful space and a great place to have a special dinner.  In anticipation of our trip to Napa later in the week, we had a red wine blend called POV from Robert Sinskey Vineyard. It is a nice full bodied red that paired very well with the beef I ordered.  We tried a variety of appetizers, and my favorite was the sweet potato tortoloni with thinly sliced mushrooms and a light broth. It was a beautifully delicate dish that was sophisticated without being too over the top.  For my entree, I had the wagyu bavette with pastrami and potato. The wagyu bavette was served with bordelaise while the pastrami was on a bed of onion jam. The wagyu bavette was very tender and had a flavorful herbed crust, and was my favorite part of the dish.  At the end of the night, my plate looked like this. I ate every bite.  I finished things off with the pepper and chocolate mousse. The hint of pepper balanced the sweetness of the chocolate. The pecans and small crispy balls of chocolate added texture. This dessert certainly inspired me to play around with the combination of pepper and chocolate.  The service at Sepia was outstanding. The servers were very knowledgeable and provided thoughtful recommendations. They also have a sommelier on hand if you need a wine recommendation.

We knew one of the cooks and he came out to talk to us for a little bit and give us some of his special, favorite appetizers. Two of the appetizers weren't on the menu, but I am assuming that the menu changes frequently. We started off with drinks. I ordered something that the waiter recommended. It was a green beverage that was very tart and had some ginger in it. It was almost like a ginger ale with a lot of lemon or lime in it as well. Then there was some bread which was arranged to look like a sort of branch or tree, branching out in different directions. It was grainy and oat-y. Following that was some sort of fish (I want to say sardine) on toast with guacamole. After that was some of the selections of house charcuterie, which was amazing. There was duck tail, duck breast, pig tongue, pork belly, and something else I'm forgetting. All of which were wonderful tasting on some great bread, with a bit of nice mustard, too. After that was a beautiful ravioli dish with pheasant in it, which was also out of this world delicious. For the entree, I ordered the Chicken dish. I tried everyone else's at the table: rabbit and bass. We also ordered some duck fat fried potatoes to share. All of the entrees were good. The chicken had some nice cherries for a sweet taste, some smashed potatoes, and, of course, the most tender, succulent, juicy chicken I've ever had with some wonderful crunchy crusty skin around it. All in all, the food was delicious tasting and it was the most ""swanky"", fancy dining experience I have ever had. This is one of those fine dining restaurants I had heard about and seen on TV, but never seen before. I associated them with stuffy businessmen and people on special occasion dates. While there is that going on, I have to put that aside and look at the food, in my view. The staff at the restaurant were all friendly with us, making conversation beyond the cheesy ""How's the weather?"" conversations of waiters at TGI Mcfunsters, as Tony Bourdain calls them. The waiter was helpful with recommendations and knowledge on the food that they were making in the back. The head chef even came out of the kitchen for a moment to talk to us. The atmosphere is interesting with its collision of combining the images of early 20th century industrial Chicago and the postmodern, avant-garde restaurant style. But all of that aside, as I am not too judgmental on a restaurant for its decor and instead am more interested in the actual food, I can honestly say that Sepia has delicious food to offer. While it is upscale and expensive, I can say its worth a visit if you are in deed having one of those special dates or occasions with people you love and want something more on the ""unique"" side as far as culinary experimentation, but not too much so, so that you can still get traditional food that you are somewhat used to.",Patrick,22190075,16118893,DINING

I also couldn’t shut up about it for the 24 hours leading up to brunch.  My parents both ordered, and loved, the Short Rib Hash. It has large pieces of short rib, stacked over roasted potatoes, and topped with a poached egg and garlic hollandaise. It’s a hearty brunch, and it kept my parents full for hours as we explored Chicago. Knowing my father, he will insist that we dine at Bar Siena next time he is in town so that he can have this again.  I had the avocado toast, which my friend Lauren had highly recommended. It comes on a garlic bread, spread with mashed avocado, topped with thinly sliced radish, and fresh tomatoes, with poached eggs on top. It was a big portion, and impossible to finish after eating so much focaccia, but I loved the flavors. The garlic was a nice addition to something that I make at home a lot.  We ended our meal with the Salted Caramel Bomboloni, an type of Italian doughnut. They are made fresh in house, served warm with sugar on the outside, and can be stuffed with your choice of filling. The caramel was superb. Bar Siena is a welcome addition to the bustling West Loop restaurant scene that brings something a little different to the neighborhood. Go for the atmosphere, stay for the food, and save room for the bomboloni.",Kit Graham,27459907,26235349,DINING
Bar Siena,https://www.zomato.com/chicago/bar-siena-west-loop/reviews,"Oct 10, 2015",3.5,"Oh Bar Siena. I wanted to love you so badly. I really did. And I’ll admit, you definitely wooed me at moments, but I didn’t fall in love. Maybe it was just a bad first date, but I’m willing to give you another try.   I wanted a nice intimate spot, but it was so loud that I could barely hear my dinner guest, let alone the meek server’s voice. Not that I can blame you for being so busy (even on a Monday night), but the excitement in the air was almost too much. Not to mention waiting over 30 minutes for our appetizers and another 30 for entrees. We’ll blame it on the Madonna concert that night. That’s probably why the kitchen was so backed up. We’ll go with that.   OK THE FOOD. It was really good. Not all mind blowing, but enjoyable enough to make me want to go back to try other things.  We started with the Fritto Misto. It was a nice surprise to have jumpo shrimp along with the calamari. It was fried well with a TON of breading, making it really rich and indulgent. It was also piping hot. I prefer my calamari more light and crispy, but the taste was still great--like good fried food. The calamari was fresh, not too rubbery. The accompanying pomodoro sauce really made the dish--it was sweet and tangy and bursting with fresh tomato flavor. The aioli we could take or leave--it had no flavor, just a great creamy texture. The presentation was also fun and creative, using measuring cups instead of ramekins for the sauces. Nice touch.   Next we had the Beef Carpaccio. It was definitely beautiful. The toast was perfectly thin and crispy, not overpowering the taste of the beef. It was really fresh and the artichoke pesto on top added a ton of flavor. The sprigs of arugula also added a nice peppery touch. It was a favorite dish, a good size to share between two people.   Their pizzas are really their specialty and it shows. You can order half and half, so did one with half Prosciutto Fig and half Grilled Eggplant. The crust was crispy on the edges and chewy in the middle with just the right amount of thickness. The Taleggio cheese on the prosecution fig side was awesome, and the honey added so much richness and creamy texture that it didn't need sauce. The flavor was complex: the salty prosciutto, bitter arugula and sweet figs all complemented each other so well, covering all flavor profiles and making for an intense flavor. The Eggplant and burrata side as probably my favorite thing of the night. Big chunks of melty, gooey burrata complimented the fresh basil and meaty grilled eggplant.   We also ordered the Burrata Stuffed Agnolotti. It was a smaller portion, but considering the fact that it had big chunks of lobster and homemade pasta, it was a good value. The lobster tasted really fresh, and the sauce was flavorful and creamy without being overly rich. The pasta also tasted freshly made, but it was a tad undercooked and the burrata wasn't as creamy and flavorful as I has hoped. Regardless, it was hearty and a comforting, beautiful dish.   For dessert we just couldn't say no to the Nutella Calzone. It was the star of the show. It was more like a stuffed pastry than a calzone, flaky crust filled with warm oozing nutella. It was served with a scoop of vanilla gelato, drizzled with chocolate sauce and topped with caramelized hazelnuts. It was just the right amount of sweet with a subtle nuttiness and perfect richness. The cool gelato with the crispy dough and warm nutella was a nice contrast of temperature and texture. It was also plated like a work of art.   So Siena, I think you were just having an off-night as far as service. You’re still young and learning. But Fabio redeemed you with his culinary works of art. So, yes, if you call me back, I will say yes to a second date.",Valerie Mirza,30400824,25177915,DINING

The tomato sauce tasted super fresh, you could tell the basil on top was also like recently plucked from the plant and overall, very tasty.   Can't wait to come back and see their late night/morning window in full affect!",Meghan Phillipp,18658780,24983428,DINING

The mezcal menu runs 6 pages - was too much for me, so tried the Mezcal flight of 3 variations. All of them excellent - it sure warms the ears pretty fast. 😉  Coming to the food - we stuck to seafood - but naturally. Had an avocado based salad, mussels with pork in a dark red soupy sauce which what white wine, and a ceviche. All 3 were exceptional. Each of them distinct with very different flavors. We followed that up with a main of Arctic char with tacos and sauce. It is written that it can be share by 2 - honestly I think 4 people can work on a single order. They showed us the fish before it was getting grilled/ roasted. It came back in a huge mound of pink fish with sauce and tacos on the side. It was a lot and we couldn’t finish it.

That is how I felt with Athena.  After seeing the amazing looking outdoor patio when passing by on Halsted I wanted to give it a try.  To be fair the patio is very impressive.  Open air on a beautiful night with an ivy covered wall and views of the buildings in Greektown is definitely an experience.  Unfortunately that's the highlight.  This could possibly be unique to my table but the service left a lot to be desired.   We didn't order drinks for 15 minutes and once we ordered our food we weren't checked on the rest of the meal. My party agreed we would have ordered at least another round of drinks if we had the opportunity.  At least there were authentic Greek beers available.   They tasted similar to polish and other European beers that many Chicagoans might be familiar with.   The food was standard Greek fare.  Saganaki was a must, just a warning if you're eating outside it doesn't get flamed at your table to avoid embarrassing situations in which your hair might catch fire.  The calamari was ok, here you get the large rings but no tentacles if that's your thing.  My party agreed the best dish was the lamb loin chops that were on special.  They gave three nice sized chops grilled well.  Everything else seemed kind of blah.  The combo plate was just stuffed with food.  I don't think any of it was particularly great but it was a lot.  My wife got the moussaka and it just seemed like there was a big tray of it in a warmer and a square just gets heated up and plopped onto the plate. The only thing I'd have to recommend is the saganaki.  It was rich and lemony and amazing.   Athena was a bit of a let down for me. You get a great atmosphere but really average food.

Some cocktail had strong alcohol taste, if you don't like them, then might feel too strong for you. Don't get drunk, seriously! The presentation of the cocktails were outstanding and interesting, such as using dry ice to create misty effect; using fire to cook the cocktail; smoking the cocktail in sugar cinnamon flavor etc... Just like Alinea, they will surprise you, but this time not the food you eat, but the cocktail you drink. The snacks they offered were quite nice too, the truffle dumpling were little too salty but full of yummy soup with strong black truffle flavor. We all agreed that the pork skin were the best! Even it came with a large sheet, we finished it with our hands in a minute! It was so crunchy and soft at the same time, with the layer of vinegar, ease of the oily pork skin, it was just perfect!

We came in a group of 12 and they have deals on their website for large groups.  We all tried at least two drinks per person and just a word of warning, they are supa strong.  Every single drink was completely unique and delicious. The Hay is for Horses had little bits of ice made of horseradish, the Zombie Panda had little balls of fruity ice. One of the drinks was served in a bottle with an ice ship inside.  One of our favorites was ""In a rock"" which essentially is an Old-Fashioned encased inside a rock-shaped piece of ice in a glass and you slingshot into the glass to break the ice and the drink fills the glass perfectly. Each drink is closer to $20-25 but totally worth it. We knew the bartender so she hooked us up with a fun teapot with a long stout filled with a different light wine. The trick is to pour it into someone else's mouth, which was great for an ice-breaker for the group and made for some hilarious times and awkward photos.  Make reservations and don't miss it.

I live right in Chicago's west loop, so going to Meli cafe for breakfast or branch is actually very convenient for me and my wife.  We used to go there almost every weekend, but since our first time there we noticed that the service was awkward, the waiters at the entrance all had a snobby attitude and a rude manner of asking people to wait.   Both me and my wife liked the food and the convince of the location so we kept going there and just ignoring the attitude, focusing on the good food and hoping our next experience will be a better one...  We noticed that those guys wont let you sit in and wait for somebody else even for a minute and even if many seats are empty, we thought it was somehow legitimate since it is a very busy place, but when my pregnant wife went inside one day and asked to be seated and to order for two while i parked outside, was asked to wait standing outside, i knew that those guys are not civilized. sorry to say that, but i cant justify somebody asking a clearly pregnant woman to wait standing outside when there are many empty seats inside, that is not acceptable and under no circumstances, at least not here in the USA where there is prosperity and respect, some immigrants unfortunately just cant adapt and understand that you don't have to be that greedy and mean to people in order to be a successful businessman.  i am not writing this against the owner(s) of Meli cafe, but as owner(s) they should know that those ladies who sit people down are no good for that job, if they think they are too good for that then they should probably leave that job for others who really need it and who are willing to strive for a better customer service.",J.P,21396891,16119202,DINING

My favorite is the ""Cloud 9"" crepe.  It is a chocolate infused crepe filled with velvety strawberry mascarpone, fresh strawberries, fresh whip cream, and Ghirardelli chocolate as a topper.

PICCOLO SOGNO DUE,https://www.zomato.com/chicago/piccolo-sogno-river-west/reviews,"Jun 19, 2011",2,"A DISAPPOINTMENT. We looked forward to our lunch at Piccolo Sogno following our son's NWU graduation for a few weeks before coming to Chicago. We had tried for dinner reservations but were told that there was a waiting list for cancellations, and not only a waiting list but a megalist--80 folks were ahead of us on that list. What a fabulous experience this lunch was going to be! (Eighty perople would never be content to wait in Cleveland.). We kept our 2:30 reservations on time and were, of course, wowed by the patio. It is Piccolo Sogno's finest point. From there both service and cuisine slid rapidly downhill. When we asked several questions and one of our party was a bit indecisive after two of us had ordered, our waiter rather bruskly clipped. ""then, I'll be back."" Ten minutes later, we were required to call him back to complete the order. We began our lunch with appetizers--the calamari fitti, squash blossoms and some sort of fresh mozzarella in proscuitto. All three were disappointing--the calamari tender, but not sweet (not the baby calamari the we are used to at Luxe and the Wild Mango in Cleveland), too many tentacles and a bit too salty, the blossoms rathy skimpy and bland and the prosciutto and mozarella, simply uninteresting. Insalata mistas were then served--mixed greens surrounded by three halved grape tomatoes (the skins of mine wrinkled, a sign of waning freshness)--the dressing was a bit on the acidic side--fine for me but my husband could not finish his. The greens were very fresh but the salads most uninteresting--they would be better dubbed ""greens with tomato."" Main courses were again a dissappointment. My husband settled for just having the lentil soup which he said was quite good. I had the green and white noodles with veal ragu--the noodles were wonderful and cooked perfectly al dente but the ragu was thick and heavy and seasoned with a bit too much rosemary (a spice that is best used sapringly with meat dishes--appropriate with a veal ragu but it would not be my choice). Our son was disappointed with his triangular pasta which he commented was overly seasoned with leek and garlic. Our daughter's margareta pizza was tasty but the crust appeared to be a pita or other type flatbread--another disappointement for such a well reviewed restuarant (dare I mention"" Piece"" where pizza is more than king!)--hers was soogy in center causing difficulty cutting. We skipped dessert, took a quick trip to the restroom and left feeling quite glad that we had settled on lunch and not waited thorough the list of 80. I have long believed that the quality of a restuarant can be judged by the ambience of the restrooms. Piccolo Sogno certainly fails in this regard. The ladies room is no match for the patio--it appears to have been overlooked in the gentrification of this site. I'm sorry that the ""dream"" did not come true for our family.

PICCOLO SOGNO DUE,https://www.zomato.com/chicago/piccolo-sogno-river-west/reviews,"Sep 09, 2009",0,"""Little Dream"" Come True. This weekend, I had the tremendous pleasure of hosting my awesome, Italian through-and-through best friend in this glorious, food-filled city. Since I can't go more than a few days without indulging in Chicago's culinary offerings, I took the liberty of planning her entire trip around eating. And, since she is a fabulous friend, she willingly entertained my need to nosh over doing super touristy things like visiting the John Hancock and Sears (yes, SEARS) Tower.  Friday night, accompanied by one of my favorite chefs of all time (my mom), we visited the acclaimed Piccolo Sogno (464 N. Halsted). Piccolo's buzzworthy patio has dominated every dining publication since the restaurant opened in July 2008, so when the hostess offered us the opportunity to experience the Tuscan escape first hand, no 60 degree evening could stand in my way. Despite my reading and research, I was hardly prepared for the breathtaking oasis of greenery and soft lighting that awaited us.   Completely distracted by the beautiful ambiance of the patio, it took me a good five minutes to even glance at the menu. Our phenomenal server, Jeff, greeted us and quickly proved that his expertise was enough to guide us through our dining adventure- no map (menu) needed. To start, Jeff recommended the antipasto appetizer, a divine collection of wood grilled vegetables (complimented perfectly by the homemade, aged balsamic vinaigrette), house cured meats, and the best Pecorino Romano cheese this side of the Atlantic.   Our appetites whet for more deliciousness, Jeff demanded (seriously, we had no choice) that we sample an appetizer-sized portion of the legendary Ravioli ""Piccolo Sogno"", an exquisite four cheese ravioli served in a butter Marsala glaze with pine nuts and fresh Parmesan shavings. The pasta was sublime, cooked to a perfect al dente. Normally not a fan of Marsala sauce, I was perplexed by the intensity of Executive Chef Tony Priolo's masterpiece. Honestly, I wanted to get a straw and slurp it off the plate, but decided to save my companions the embarrassment by dipping delicious rosemary foccacia bread in it instead (a practice we refer to as ""dinge-ing"" in my family).  To cleanse our palettes, we ordered the Insalata di Pesche (Peaches) and the Insalata special for the evening- shaved artichoke over a bed of baby arugula, dressed in a heavenly lemon oil. It's difficult to imagine that a salad could be so damn good, and consequently we spent the rest of the weekend dissecting the flavors in hopes that my Jersey-Italian BFF could recreate this incredible dish at home (we think we have it figured out!).   After having already sampled so many wonderful dishes, we seriously contemplated our ability (and need, really) to eat dinner. Using my perpetual justification that my brother/roommate could enjoy any leftovers, we dove head first into the entree section of the menu, taking Jeff's spot-on recommendation to order appetizer servings of the Pasta and Risotto specials and the dinner portion of the Veal special. And they were exactly that- special. The pasta, infused with truffles, could have been overpowering and potent, but instead was silky and gratifying. Similarly, the veal was juicy and breaded, the large cut served simply without the distractions of a sauce or glaze. After sampling those two dishes, I barely had room to enjoy my perfectly cooked, incredibly rich vegetable Risotto.  Fulfilling my promise to bring leftovers home meant leaving room for dessert, and Jeff (who was really proving to be a wonderful tour guide) brought us a decadent chocolate and hazelnut cake, paired with a sweet Moscato, that we devoured in a few minutes (okay, seconds).

Warm, straight-from-the-oven cinnamon rolls are one of the most delightful and comforting foods ever. Formento’s rolls follow a classic preparation resulting in soft doughy cinnamon rolls with a sweet icing. For my friends who had not dined at Formento’s previously, this was a great welcome. The fruit came straight from Green City Market, and was a nice pre meal snack. Next we had the prosciutto and melon salad which was especially fantastic since melon is so good this time of year.  This salad is also present on the lunch and dinner menus, and the sweet fruit and salty meat combo is mouthwateringly good. Then we dove into three different crostini (fun fact: the singular of crostini is crostino). The Avocado Smash is their version of the insanely popular avocado toast, which came topped with heirloom tomatoes. All of the crostini came on a soft bread that made the sometimes difficult task of eating avocado toast quite easy. The bread was cut into pieces and could be eaten without falling apart. My favorite crostini was the Soft Scrambled Egg with mushrooms and arugula. The egg was scrambled and cooked until it was just at the point where it was almost a solid – exactly how I love my scrambled eggs. Thin slivers of mushrooms and fresh arugula were added on top, complimenting the eggs. The final course featured Formento’s brunch specialties. The Lemon Ricotta Pancakes were superb; light and fluffy with a nice lemon flavor and topped with a summer berry compote. I will be ordering these again. The Italian American Breakfast combined eggs, sausage, hash browns (which came in a perfectly crispy block that was tender in the middle), peppers, and onions.

The staff here is genuine and very friendly and make you feel right at home. The food is excellent and the prices were very reasonable.

The review was especially hard on the restaurant's service. I actually hoped to witness the same horrible service. Remarks such as the restaurant staff pushing to quickly turn the tables and rushing the patrons through meals were especially intriguing to me. Well, my dear friend and I enjoyed a WONDERFUL evening at La Sardine which included excellent service and fabulous food. If bad service means that the server checks to ensure that the food is gluten free, I'll take bad service anytime. And if bad service means perfectly timed courses with valet service that knows when you are concluding your meal, that's the kind of bad service I desire. I am so glad I disregarded that review and decided to experience this fine French restaurant for myself. I can't always be in Paris, but I can get a touch of it in Chicago.

La Sardine,https://www.zomato.com/chicago/la-sardine-west-loop/reviews,"Dec 17, 2012",2,"Awful dining experience - WILL NOT RETURN. My boyfriend and I went to dinner for the first time at La Sardine this past weekend. We have been to other french restaurants in chicago so we were excited to try this one out. Upon being seated, we made the mistake of asking for a table towards the front of the restaurant. The hostess made a comment about how ""you'll need to be patient with your waiter because i've sat several people in his section already"". We thought this was a strange comment since we were there at 5:30pm, and the restaurant only had a few tables full while the majority of the place was empty.   The waitor refused to acknowledge any of our questions unless he was ready to talk about the topic (i.e. don't ask about the food when he is asking you for your wine/drink order because once he's done with taking the order he doesn't want to talk about anything else and will just walk away while you're in the middle of your question). After a few rounds of this passive aggressive rudeness, we were just starting to eat our entree (about an hour into arriving for dinner), when the waitor comes over to tell us that if we wanted a souffle, we should order it now because it takes 20-25 minutes to cook. We told him we didn't mind waiting for the souffle after our entree course, and the waiter responded with ""well I can't give you this table all night"". We had been there for 1 HOUR! We weren't even sure what we wanted for dessert. After some more rude comments from the waitor, we asked to speak to the manager, who was unappologetic and told us that it is the policy of the restuarant to try to get patrons in and out as soon as possible. This does not lend to a comfortable dining experience. You cannot rush people through dinner if they have only been there for 1 hour and just received their entree course about 10-15 minutes prior. Especially if the diner ordered a bottle of wine. Did they expect us to inhale all of the food and bottle of wine and be done in 30 minutes? Needless to say, the food was good (so no offense to the chef) but the poor service makes the food underwhelming and we will NOT be returning.  If you are looking for a nice restaurant to spend a relaxing dinner at, La Sardine is NOT WHERE YOU WANT TO BE. You're better off at Kiki's Bistro where the overall experience is an enjoyable one. You will not get an authentic french dining experience at this place.",Tam_71781,23391052,16101862,DINING

Located at 951 West Fulton Market in an area currently under heavy construction, both roads and nearby buildings ravaged but Grant Achatz’s open-kitchen tribute to modernized fire cooking standing strong, it was with reservations made via TOCK confirmed that a seat was immediately offered at the Chef’s counter on arrival, the team already hard at work and soon picking up steam as the dining room filled.  Toqued from the start by Andrew Brochu and open for dinner nightly plus three days of Brunch starting at 10:00am, the menus sharing ideas but entirely distinct save for a few key dishes, it was from offerings fairly similar to those listed online that five plates were selected, a request to have them coursed one-by-one not a problem at all and the first arriving no more than ten minutes later featuring tangy housemade Yogurt ready to be mixed with textural Granola and scooped up with Fry Bread whose Powdered Sugar topping provided just enough sweetness to make it all work.  Without doubt a Restaurant where all but those planning to focus solely on their companions are benefitted by seats around the kitchen, the timing and precision of all four Chefs not unexpected but impressive nonetheless, it was no sooner that last bites of plate one were wiped up that Roister’s ”Cinnamon Toast” arrived, a thick smear of Foie Gras atop housemade Bread essentially playing Peanut Butter’s role in a decadent PB&J given depth by freshly cracked Pepper.  Seeing a lot of sweet yet savory ideas across the menu, those familiar with Alinea’s flavor profile likely expecting such, it was in a low-bowl of Grits with lots of heat and umami that Brunch’s most bold flavor was presented and although a fairly small portion the big flavors are nonetheless best shared while the same cannot be said of a pillowy Waffle topped with Brochu’s famous fried Chicken that most will want to keep all for themselves.  Debating both the Foie Gras Candy Bar and pricey Wagyu Burger but deciding the better part of valor was instead saving space for that night’s Loyalist-Smyth two-fer it was instead in Cookies & Milk that the meal wrapped just prior to noon, a Dessert almost as well-regarded as the dinner-only whole Chicken proving not only delicious and texturally compelling but a true study in how to stoke childhood memories without relying too heavily on Sugar.",Michael U.,24564296,37829738,DINING

Based on this one interaction, I find their service to be extremely troubling.  In my opinion, the decision to ask for the 4 IDs was based on RACE. There was a younger, white barback who was snickering, somewhat aggressively, when the female white bartender asked for the IDs. The barback had the look of a high school dropout with a big future in crystal meth addiction.   I would suggest NOT going to Haymarket Pub, no matter what the craft beers are like, no matter what type of service other people have received. Racial profiling is unacceptable.

Haymarket Pub & Brewery,https://www.zomato.com/chicago/haymarket-pub-brewery-west-loop/reviews,"Jan 13, 2011",2,"Severely Disappointed. I have been looking forward to HayMarket opening since about March 22, 2010, when I overheard Pete Crowley talking about his future departure of Rock Bottom, to open up his own brewpub. I was ecstatic and practically counting the days until I could experience, non-rock bottom, Pete Crowley brews. FINALLY the license was for the brewpub approved and the doors were open!!! I went in on Saturday January 1, around 10:30pm or so, with my husband and our good friend; between the three of us, two being chefs and me being a cicerone, home-brewer and avid restaurant goer, we are all very accustomed to brewpubs and craft beer.  Upon arriving, my husband, not knowing much about Pete and his past brewery assignment, immediately asked if this was an off-chute of Rock Bottom due to the décor and general restaurant set up. We all agreed that there was not much individuality to the dining area, which was just the first of many disappointments. Next, our server, who I am pretty sure has never waited a table in his life, was awkward and unknowledgeable. The beer list was definitely something I have never seen in my life - over whelmed by IPAs, Double IPA, American IPA and then some random American Browns, and Macro Brews. YES Macros: not just one, but I am pretty sure there were four, which is quite baffling due to the respect craft brewers are constantly working for, the reason they put in 16 hour brew days to produce a quality product.   We went into HayMarket to try some of Pete's brews, which we understood that they were not completed yet - fermenting and conditioning cannot be rushed! However, that unknowledgeable server of ours, should have been made aware of when the brews were to be released, his lack of unrueful knowledge was more disappointing than not having the brews on tap.   I am not going to get into the food menu here - seeing that it is first week of opening, the food was plain, lackluster, trying-too-hard to be Goose Island Clybourn's menu, to be anything that I will crave or even snack on in the future (for information, seeing that we went in late, we could only order off the light night menu, however we did ask to see a full menu to see their daily offerings). Just a few minor comments: We were a bit surprised to hear that they were out of bacon, considering our server said it was house cured - that should be in abundance seeing that is made in-house. The ""home-made"" catsup tasted like out-of-jar marinara, which in the first place is a waste to consume, but to put HayMarket's name on it is even worse. Finally, as we looked over the menu, there were just about as many vegan items as meat products, WHY? Beer pairs best with meat and meat associates, as a result abundance or at least majority of items on the menu should be meat eater friendly.   I will be returning after the January 20th HayMarket beer release date, probably not with my husband and friend in tow, for they have no interest in going to an ""Applebee's"" type restaurant. However I am very excited to see what Pete has in store (literally-in the fermenters). The equipment looks great, the brewer is amazing, and I can only hope for the best in quality, creative and artistic beers that this award winning brewer has to offer.",Contrivecards,21656544,16171039,DINING

I can't really say much about the service, since I was at the restaurant on for lunch on a Friday when there were only 1 or 2 other tables to serve; therefore, our table was well taken care of.   The decor is fun! It reminded me a little bit of the colorful atmosphere at Carnivale (not quite as colorful- but that's hard to do.) I also like that you can watch them prepare and cook their wood fired pizzas, as the oven close to center of the restaurant.   As for the taste of that pizza - DELICIOUS! I agree with any other reviewer who said order a pizza for an appetizer. I would even say make it your meal and you won't be disappointed but then you would miss out on some amazing pasta. I tried the artichoke and black olive as well as the pizza with burratta and I can't decide which was better.  I actually ordered the risotto adriatico (seafood risotto) and it was extremely flavorful with a little spiciness. Be prepared for oyster/clam shells as well as some calamari (rings and tentacles), shrimp, and scallops. The oysters and clams were cooked just so that I barely had to do more than sweep my fork across the shell to get the meat out. I couldn't get over how wonderfully all those flavors worked so well together! I would defiinitely suggest this dish for any seafood lover (caution: I generally do not like to eat clams/oyster or calamari so I may not know exactly how they were supposed to taste, but my unrefined taste buds loved them in this dish).   Beyond the risotto, others with me ordered the prosciutto, an eggplant pasta, a few of the salad, all of which were enjoyed.",Anna,22563042,16118941,DINING

WE had a table of four people and ordered pizza(known for)Antipasti plates, Rosotto, Pastas and two salads.  The Rustica Salad was amazing!  The rest of the food was tastless.  The reason I mentioned the chef off that night....someone should have tasted that food before it left the kitchen.  The tomato sauce was so ordinary, the Risotto was runny and soaking in way too much wine, which was all I tasted.  WE ended with the Lava Cake which was recommended by the server.  It was not very warm at all.  was not worth the calories....as it should be.  It was overall a dissapointing night of a beautiful restaurat and no love in your food.

It's beautiful, in every sense of the way, the obvious way, the not so obvious way, and in any other way that you can think of.  We came here on a Saturday for a few drinks and some good food. It's gorgeous, very well decorated, beautifully lit with abundant natural light and really high ceilings. The interiors and every single detail of the place is eclectic in nature, yet very coherent.   We listed our name down on the waiting list and ordered a couple of drinks at the bar. We wanted to sit on the second floor because it was a little more intimate than the seating on the first floor. After about a half hour when we were finished with our drinks, we were shown to our table. Our server was extremely helpful and nice and gave us suggestions when needed. Here's what we ordered:   Falling Oaxacan (Anand really enjoyed this drink.) Fino Blend (I think this was what I ordered, haha, I liked it.) Picante De La Casa (We ordered 4 of these. These were brilliant! Spicy margaritas so to speak.) Chocolate Croissant (This was not warmed up, it tasted nice.) Allis All Day Breakfast (I got this with spinach instead of smoked salmon. The scrambled eggs were really tasty and everything on the plate was cooked to perfection.) Halloumi & Charred Cauliflower Sandwich (This was amazing. Really different and packed with flavors.) Devil's Food Cake (Moist chocolate cake, very well baked.) Chouquette Sundae (This was new to me. It's a sundae made with Chouquette pastries. Delicious!)  We did go overboard and ate A LOT. Realized this as I was writing this review, but, it definitely was very tempting. The service was really good and so was the ambiance. It isn't a place I would frequent often to, given that it is slightly expensive for a regular brunch. That being said, I definitely recommend this place.

The Allis Chicago,https://www.zomato.com/chicago/allis-lounge-west-loop/reviews,"Apr 08, 2015",4.5,"Allis Lounge. The Allis is hands down one of the coolest spaces in Chicago. The rustic mets refined decor includes massive chandeliers, plush velvet chairs, wooden tables, a long marble bar, exposed brick, and oversized windows that let the light pour in. The menu at The Allis is short and simple, but in the best possible way. It includes several items from the bakery, and a variety of egg dishes. This isn’t the place for Eggs Benedict and French Toast, but that is ok. The Allis (pronounced like “Alice”) is one of the three restaurants on the first floor of the SoHo House that are open to the public. Each restaurant has a completely different look, feel, and menu. Chicken Shop is a casual eatery with a vintage vibe that focuses on rotisserie chicken, burgers, and sides, while Pizza East, on the other side of the building has serves up pizzas and pastas. The Allis sit between Chicken Shop and Pizza East, and is the most formal of the trio. I very recently discovered the breakfast at The Allis and it has secured its spot as my go to for Sunday brunch. On my visit visit to The Allis I ordered Soft Eggs with Soldiers. Charles was impressed by how British I was by choosing it. I paired it will English Breakfast Tea – which I always drink all day long. The eggs could have been a bit runnier, but it was a wonderful lighter breakfast. When I returned to The Allis a few days later, I ordered one of the breakfast sandwiches. “The Mean” is an egg sandwich with crispy bacon, taleggio, cheddar, avocado, greens, and a spicy aioli. It is served on a soft roll, and I happily devoured every bite. Charles ordered The Allis Breakfast, which is a more European style breakfast with toast, hard boiled egg, tomato, avocado, and smoked salmon. He loved it. Everything at The Allis is made in house – the only exceptions are the bagels and the honey. The marmalades, breads, pastries, etc. are all made in house. They even juice their own fruit juice. While they focus on simple classics, they are prepared with exacting attention to detail, and it shows. The Allis also serves lunch, afternoon tea, and small plates and cocktails in the evenings. I am dying to try the afternoon tea – I have heard great things. The Allis is located at 113 North Green Street, in Chicago’s West Loop.

We walked around a little before the show, scoping out the “cheap seats” for our next visit – there really aren’t any “bad” seats in the place, but you wouldn’t want to be too far along the side walls of the venue. The acoustics were great, the view was decent and the restrooms only a few steps away.    We had front row seats for singer/comedian Stephen Lynch and shared the tiniest of tables with an adorable couple from the ‘burbs – to say the tables are “small” is an understatement – think half the size of a folding card table, topped with full place settings for four. Tight. Damn tight. While we introduced ourselves, and laughed off the proximity of our seating, our server extraordinaire recommended an awesome 12-year-old red wine (by the glass, no less!) to my wife and, for me, the first of many (many!) Bulleit Bourbon Old Fashioned cocktails.    We started with some appetizers for the table; the Imported Italian Burrata ($15) featured a massive ball of milky, salty mozzarella cheese and a large portion of olive-oil soaked tommy-toe tomatoes with thickly sliced, perfectly-toasted bread – certainly the highlight of the evening. The Dipping Flight ($13) came with a dollop of flavorless hummus, runny babaganuj and a tiny portion of cold pitas. The Crispy Risotto Balls ($12) were neither crispy or warm, and the goat cheese fondue was set up like a brick of Velveeta. When we handed back our barely touched Dipping Flight and Risotto Balls, our server immediately caught on – and she made up for the faux pas by delivering a round of complimentary drinks.    Sadly, dinner wasn’t much better. The small ramekin of brownish meat for the Braised Duck Tacos ($13) was cold and tasted like sweetly-sauced barbecued chicken. The plate also featured the smallest white corn tortillas we’ve ever seen – barely the size of a beer can coaster. The side dish of Fingerling Potatoes ($9) were certainly reheated in the microwave and had a funky lemony back taste. The wife’s Kale Salad ($12) was nicely portioned and had a large serving of quinoa, croutons and was perfectly dressed with a flavorful anchovy dressing.    During the entire evening, our server was remarkably attentive and, as promised, kept the bourbon coming for the duration of the performance. She was so spot-on, the neighboring table twice leaned in to ask if they could “borrow” our waitress – apparently their server went AWOL between courses.

Next Bistro doesn't come close to being the best bistro food or Chicago restaurant we have experienced. Nothing would draw us back for the bistro menu, and we wonder what the buzz is about over priced food. Amuse-Bouche was delightful presentation, tasty though not as uplifting as eye appealing. The potato and leek soup was the best course I had last night. Great flavor, artfully garnished. Those who selected the endive salad felt the dressing was a thick glop on the lettuce and the cheese was very strange. No one in our group could finish theirs, even the salad lovers.  The skate wing fish course would have been another favorite, I've had it at restaurants prepared similarly for the price of the up charge alone at next. In this meal the Brussel sprouts were so overcooked as to be a mush on the bottom of the plate. Those in our party who selected the lobster with artichoke in puff pastry enjoyed that first course much more than what the others in our group had. It was delicious. The onion tart,however, was the worst. Think onion soup without the broth. Onions cooked to a slippery slime with a thick layer of melted cheese on top. It should have been a real savory item, but it was so mushy as to be unappealing.  The leg of lamb was extremely rare. Olives were identifiable in the sauce, all other vegetables were so overcooked to be unidentifiable to me except for the suspected outline of a tomato. But that's only a guess.  Baba au rhum and the banana with golden raisin desserts were good. Rum made the cake rather boozy, though the taste reminded us of some of the wonderful flavored rums we've had on St. Martin.  I can't say enough kind words for the impeccable service and courteous staff. They made dining there a pleasure. Thank you.

From start to finish it was completely what I expected, a fully composed meal where each course flowed logically to the next. Both the wine and non alcoholic pairings were spot on, as was the duck course. My only real issue food wise was with the fish course. Seasoning seemed a bit off, which surprised me given the normal robotic execution Achatz, Beran, etc operate with. But that also makes me stop and wonder if this was anyone besides the team behind Alinea would I even make a note of something being slightly too salty? Or have I been conditioned to expect only 100% perfection from these men? Which if I have been, is completely unrealistic. The biggest issue I had was with the service. It was absolutely all over the place. Ashley was fantastic, as was the young man walking the dining room all night. But once we got down to the servers and runners it was hit or miss. It seemed that they were all trying to provide high end service while still maintaining some kind of relaxed banter; which under normal circumstances I love. But to have a runner drop plates off with a 'I really don't know what this is', followed by the second saying 'Yeah I really don't either. Its a few different ways to plate some fish', really doesn't fly with me. There was one guy who had awesome deadpan one liners, but still managed to convey what we were about to eat and offer a little history lesson.

I took advantage of a Groupon offering for Nia, and left with a bad taste in my mouth by their reneging on offers, and the way they handle customer concerns. Clearly, there are many restaurants along Randolph fighting to earn your business, and you'd be happier elswhere for your overall dining experience.  Complaint 1: At least have the courtesy to tell me personally that you cancelled my OpenTable Reservation, instead of going back to the computer 20 minutes after I checked in to cancel it because I presented a Groupon.   Complaint 2: I want a glass of wine - don't try so hard to upsell me a bottle, especially if I just told you ""No thank you, all I want is a glass"".  Complaint 3: The check states ""5% discount on cash payments"". They would not honor it. Why? Oh.... because I presented a Groupon.  I spoke with a manager, and she told me the Groupon states no other offers honored. There is nothing on the Groupon that states this, and there is nothing about not honoring OpenTable points. And if the 5% discount is not honored, then don't print the offer on my check, and tell the waitress not to treat me like crap because I asked for the discount.   The way a restaurant handles customer's issues determines if they will earn return business, and they have not earned mine.

D'Amato's Bakery,https://www.zomato.com/chicago/damato-s-bakery-west-town/reviews,"Apr 21, 2019",4,"So a man walks into an Italian bakery in a seemingly run-down neighborhood. Two or three women are fussing over a cookie display while an industrious looking lady hurries in from the kitchen door with freshly baked cannolis and an accent which you thought was meant only for movies. The man looks around and spots a ridiculously shiny, bronzed old style espresso machine. He has his quintessential, big town, old neighborhood, ""Coming to America"" moment. And this is all before he has even ordered anything.   Every major city in the world has a few old style bakeries where even today the prices are unbelievable, the food fresh and the atmosphere pungent with nostalgia. This comes at the cost of the quality of ingredients at times or the menu being a tad out-dated. But these places remain the solid defining threads of a city's culinary fabric. D'amato's a random Google maps' find on a visit to Chicago, is one such gem.  A neat old style Italian bakery, this place offers all sort of cakes, pastries, cookies, pizzas and breads. We went here to pick up a few cookies for tea and coffee and left with stomachs fuller than we thought they could be. I tried the cheese pizza, chocolate and pistachio cannoli and 1-2 cookies. This was about 1-2 hours after a substantial lunch elsewhere. We took home a whole box full of fresh cookies for about 8-10$.  The pizza was warm, extremely cheesy, the size of 400 page novel and very nice. I bought their last chocolate cannoli for the day and found it to be much better than the pistachio one which was basically covered with green dyed peanuts. The filling was fresh and creamy and the pastry very crisp and flaky. The people were friendly and the food as fresh as you could expect. There was a mild lingering taste of slightly inferior fat and the presence of excessive food coloring was obvious in a lot of items on display. Despite this, the sheer deliciousness, freshness and pricing in this day and age in a bustling metropolis like Chicago gets a 4.5/5 from me.",Yash Babar,188202,42663521,DINING

I am on a serious winning streak these days, and I love it. Most recently, my crew (how lucky are they?!) and I enjoyed the fruit of my luck for brunch. More precisely, a boozy brunch at Nellcôte. Jealous? I would be.  If you have never been to Nellcôte, you owe yourself a little trip to Randolph street. Granted, it is crowded and loud in the evening. But brunch is a different story. On our visit the music was subdued and the service effortless. No one around us ordered Red Bull cocktails or wore pleather pants. Brunch here might be a little less rock’n’roll, but hey, even The Rolling Stones eat breakfast, right? Nellcôte is pretty at brunch time, all details of the interior clearly visible. See for yourself.  I am a serious connoisseur of brunch, however, more times than not brunch menu is an afterthought. Not here though, at Nellcôte brunch is serious business. From cocktails to desserts, the menu appears to be well thought through and well executed. Start with Nellcôte Bellini, a refreshing cocktail of Prosecco, St. Germaine & Hangar 1 Citrus vodka. Sip it over lovely Brunch Share Plate of delicious goodies, both sweet and savory (on our visit: madeleines, brioche, prosciutto, gruyere cheese, tea-poached plums, house made butter & jam).  Lobster Hash is always a good choice (duh!), and we enjoyed the pork chop with tangy fregola-dried apricot salad on the side. Hangar Steak & Eggs came perfectly medium rare, accompanied by crisp tender wax beans. However, the dish I ordered stole the show in my humble opinion. What can I say? I am still WINNING! Modest looking & sounding, fresh spaghetti with smoked house-made bacon, Pecorino and one hour egg was an exercise in both simplicity and indulgence. Tender strands of fresh pasta coated in unctuous runny egg, studded with crispy bacon shards and topped with a savory mound of Pecorino. YUM! Sometimes less is definitely more…  When it comes to desserts, I am generally not a taker. I don’t have a sweet tooth. So, I opted to drink my dessert (hello, rose sparkling wine…) instead. However, my lucky crew decided to indulge, and rightfully so. I mean, Mick Jagger would order dessert. Maybe. Possibly. Right? Desserts at Nellcôte look and taste fabulous! Just look at their version of Far Breton with warm caramel poured table side. Well-played, Nellcôte, well-played.

I had a great time catching up with a fun group of my food blogging friends. We dined at Nellcote, which is in the heart of Chicago’s food scene: the West Loop. I feel that I should mention that I walked 1.7 miles through the slushy sidewalk in 18 degree cold to get there. Why? The bus wasn’t coming anytime soon, I had 20 minutes to burn, I had already spent $60 in cabs over the weekend, I figured it counted as a workout, and I feel that by telling you this it will give me some street cred. Needless to say my toes were a little cold when I arrived at the restaurant.  Nellcote’s space is very modern and chic, and feels quite European. In the summertime they have a generous amount of sidewalk seating. The interior space has a large bar in the center and is divided into two levels. This keeps the space from feeling to stark.  As soon as I arrived I ordered a pot of hot tea, so I could warm up. Then folks at Nellcote generously set out several sunny side up breakfast pizzas with mozzarelle, fontina and arugula as an appetizer. Please excuse the blurry photo below, apparently I take poor photos when I am hungry. One really unique fact about Nellcote is that they mill their own flour for their pizzas and pastas. They sell the flour and the pasta at the restaurant.  Next I had the fresh spaghetti with smoke bacon, pecorino, and a one-hour egg. You might be wondering what a one-hour egg is. Well, it is an egg that is slow poached until it reaches a perfect 63 degrees. Many chefs consider 63 degrees to be the perfect temperature for a poached egg because at that temperature the white and the yolk are the same consistency. The yolk spills out of the white, mixes with the pecorino, and becomes a sauce for the pasta. This was a beautifully balanced dish. I loved the texture of the thick spaghetti, the slight saltiness of the pecorino, the creamy egg yolk, and the thick pieces of smokey bacon.  I believe that little gestures at restaurants go a long way, and Nellcote passed this test beautifully. My water glass was always full. My glass of (free) Prosecco was topped off several times. My pot of tea was refilled the moment I finished it. And most surprisingly, the checks were individually split for everyone in our large group. Clearly Nellcote is a perfect place to go with a group.  Nellcote is located at 833 West Randolph Street, and they do accept reservations for brunch.",Kit Graham,27459907,23429844,DINING

Nelcotte, despite its chic, vogue atmosphere, is not the ""restaurant"" one should choose if they are in the mood for a ""meal."" I don't mind paying for what I get; however, at Nellcotte you're paying for what you DO NOT get! All of their portions are 4oz with the exception of their tiny pizzas. (I must admit their pizzas are amazing, as they mill their own flour and bake their own bread.) Speaking of bread, you must pay to SAMPLE this phenomenal bread, and they don't give you enough to fill a cavity. Other than my beef, pardon the pun, with the portion sizes the taste of the samples they provide are overall pleasing to the palate. Their cocktail prices are average for a Downtown Chicago establishment. Overall I take issue with: 1) The extremely small portion sizes and the ridiculous prices they charge for them. 2) The fact that they bring each ""dish"" to the table as it is comes out of the kitchen. They do not bring out your entire party's food at the same time. This creates an ad lib dining experience. 3) You constantly have different servers/bus staff bringing food to your table. The only time you know who your server actually is, is when s/he stops by to see if you need more cocktails. If you're in the mood for appetizers and drinks, by all means, Nellcotte is a great choice. Otherwise, look to one of Chicago's many fine dining establishments for a real meal!",Tony Z.,21532546,16177426,DINING

Nellcote,https://www.zomato.com/chicago/nellc%C3%B4te-west-loop/reviews,"Jun 21, 2012",4.5,"Had a good time. Had dinner here with my wife and a group of our friends for my birthday and we all had a very nice time. The bartenders were respectable and our waiter was nice and knew his way around the menu. This sounds like something you would assume about all waiters but take it from a frequent business traveler, you’d be wrong. We started with drinks at the bar and three different pizzas: the organic egg, the broccoli, and the buffalo mozzarella. You can’t go wrong with either of the first two pizzas, and the buffalo had a very light and fresh taste. We sampled every drink on the menu plus a few more that weren’t, and the vodka and the punch were the winners of our very unscientific taste test. For dinner we sampled just about everything on the menu and we all loved the taglioni, the lamb, the ribeye, the rabbit, and the sturgeon. The one dish that left us all feeling a little flat was the squid ink strozzapreti. This dish is served cold with shredded lobster meat and mint atop a plate/bowl of pasta where the squid ink seemed to serve no purpose other than to dye the pasta a dark black color. This is definitely a nice choice for groups if you like sharing small plates and trying lots of different dishes. The only drawback for groups is the small outdoor area that can’t accommodate large parties.",Alex,22912623,16177420,DINING

This was the first time the five of us had actually been able to get together as a full group (as one of us now lives in an entirely different country!), so we were filled to the brim with stories and jonesing to share a really fabulous meal. Nellcôte, open since 2012, is one of those semi-hidden gems in the West Loop. Everyone is familiar with the restaurant as a perfect spot for dinner and drinks, but it's seems to be less on the radar for brunch. I'm almost reluctant to rave about it too much, as I don't want it to be taken over by masses of brunch-happy Chicagoans. ;-)  (photo courtesy of Nellcôte) Nellcôte draws both its moniker and its influence from Villa Nellcôte, the French mansion once inhabited by the Rolling Stones. The Euro-chic space drips with crystal chandeliers and is outfitted with a Parisian herringbone wood floor, Art Nouveau wrought-iron gates, Gran Dossier Tolix bar chairs in Hermès orange, and white Italian marble staircase. While the restaurant is most definitely sexy and opulent, it's also comfortable, approachable, and filled with whimsical touches (including these gorgeous chairs that I would love to smuggle over to my place!)  (interior details photos courtesy of Ashley )   Having previously brunched at Nellcôte with Chicago Food Bloggers , I was excited to share the gorgeous space and delicious food with my blogger crew.

You remember the day:  perfectly sunny with gorgeous robin egg blue skies and a cool breeze.  One of those days that makes you thankful for Chicago summer and encourages you to play hooky.  It was a perfect summer day.  I was spending the day researching my articles.  Research is demanding.  Research is tedious.  Research involves a glass of cava in the sun?  Oh, the things I have to do in the name of research!  So, allow me to take you to my lovely discovery:  South Branch Tavern and Grill in the South Loop.  This new place is not your run of the mill downtown bar.  Nevermind the gorgeous sunny patio and outside bar facing both the Chicago River and the skyscrapers of the Loop.  Anything would taste delicious in this alfresco environment, believe me!  So, here is where things are tremendously different at South Branch:  the food here is surprisingly good!  Try the bacon wrapped Cajun shrimp or the buffalo rolls or mussels, and you will know what I mean.  The fare here is straight forward with an upscale twist, executed well and, even more surprisingly, very affordable!  The biggest surprise of all, however, comes with the wine list.  Fully prepared to have another glass of tasteless pinot grigio (because everything tastes good outside, right?!), I took one look at the list and did a double take.  Those of you who aren’t wine enthusiasts, please forgive me for what I am about to do.  I am about to show my “cork dork” colors!  This downtown bar boasts a great selection of wines that would impress any wine snob!  With names like Dampierre, Emeritus, Flowers, Au Bon Climat, Bethel Heights, Orin Swift just to name a few, this list is a far cry from generic pinot grigio.  What after work bar in the Loop offers you great cava or Sancerre or Chablis or Albarino?  So, next time you are looking for me on a Friday afternoon, check the patio at the South Branch.  I will likely be there sipping a glass of [insert name of excellent wine here] and doing… research.  What can I say?

Another looper sampled the falafel sandwich and loved everything about it. The last looper ordered the grilled portobello sandwich and claimed she had never had anything like it before. It was so large, though, it made her feel a little comatose later. This was no fault of Twisted Spoke. All in all, this lunch spot presented us with great ambience and a great meal.

There were two large plates for the appetizer course, and three for the main course, plus lots of basmati and naan (pita-like bread) in either regular or with some garlic butter and herbs on top. The dessert was the only things small -- it was one scoop of ice cream that I had no room left to try.  The quality was outstanding. Very rich and zesty, but maybe a hair less heat than I'm used to. But I actually preferred it at a level where it didn't mask the flavors or become uncomfortably spicy, as is so often the case in other places.

Located right beside the Morgan el stop in the West Loop, Bar Takito has a large sidewalk patio seating area, and a spacious interior with two bars. The space is bright and colorful and has lots of seating. The menu features Mexican, Central, and South American food with a modern twist. This isn’t the type of place that serves guacamole. Instead they specialize in more unique offerings inspired by seasonal ingredients. We started with the Chorizo & Chicken Arepa. An arepa is a corn pancake, and at Bar Takito it has whole kernels of corn. It was then topped with mushrooms, pickled vegetables, chorizo, chicken, and an aji peanut sauce. The chicken was fried in large pieces, while the chorizo was finely chopped. I really enjoyed the arepa and the sauce, but I think that there was a little too much going on here. Next time I would order the Vegetarian Arepa instead. Next up, two orders of tacos. Takito is known for it’s tacos and they lived up to the hype. The menu includes four different types of tacos, which are served in orders of three. We chose to try the Brunkow Cheese and Coffee Braised Beef tacos. The Brunkow Cheese Tacos came with a large piece of grilled brunkow cheese, pickled jicama, arugula, peanuts, ahi peanut sauce, and a slice of avocado.

Most importantly, you make an excellent margarita. I'd appreciate if you'd pick up the tab though because post-college life ain't treatin me super well.   My equally single girlfriend suggested we ditch the Barefoot and plastic cups, and pretend to be classy women for a night. We headed to Bar Takito, where their cute alfresco dining space fits well into the gentrifying neighborhood. But, it being June in Chicago and technically still winter, we opted to sit indoors. It was 6:30 pm on a Friday night, and we had made reservations. It was still empty when we walked in, but quickly filled up.   Our server first asked if we had any dietary concerns she needed to be aware of. When I told her of my dairy allergy, she pointed out several items to steer away from. We each ordered a margarita to start: I had the La Paloma and my friend ordered the Cucumber Margarita. I don’t believe in mixing vegetables and alcohol, but I have to say her drink was incredibly refreshing. My La Paloma was served in a clay jar, in which I was instructed avoid drinking out of with my lips AT ALL COSTS. “Only use the straw, obviously,” the server stated, and I nodded my head as if yes, of course I knew not to drink out clay jars because I regularly use them as my drinking vessel of choice. Later in the evening, we both got a classic margarita, which was equally as good (and I was allowed to ditch the straw).  My friend was very vocal about her desire to try the Octopus a la Plancha, so I decided to pretend I was just as daring and agreed. My god, I can now say I’m an octopus fan. I would go back and just order that dish. Garlicy, crispy, and not at all fishy, the sautéed octopus was served with lemon potatoes. If we were drinking Barefoot wine out of our plastic cups I would have totally licked the dish. Next, we ordered the Roasted Mushroom dish. Hearty and flavorful, my hamburger loving friend and I hardly missed the meat.  Our total bill was around $70. Was it worth it? Yes and I will go back. We realized later we really didn’t eat enough, but the margz were sufficient for the time being.   I will say I was a little overwhelmed by the amount of friendly staff members who kept approaching our table. The chef came out and talked through both dishes with us. The hostess was kind enough to share her drink recommendations. And there was this other dude who insisted on taking my jacket and hanging it up near the bathroom. He may have been a guest who just couldn’t stand the sight of my cheap leather coat, but I still don’t entirely know what his role was.

First stop up is the oh so cool Bar Takito. I call it cool because that's what I said upon entering. They designed a very vibrant dining room that works great for brunch. Plenty of sunshine coming in thru the windows. Located in the West loop just a stones throw from the Morgan Station this place is the sister restaurant to Bar Takito, an upscale taco place I've enjoyed in the past. Newly Opened in the West Loop While Takito focuses mainly on modern contemporary Mexican flavors Bar Takito pays homage to all of Latin America. For starters we went with the Carolina Gold Rice. The top shelf grains are mixed with big juicy pieces of choclo corn, pickled veggies, basil and pistachios. One of the more satisfying non-meat rice dishes I can remember. Light but full of flavor. Carolina Gold Rice  Bar Takito boasts designer tacos on both their brunch and dinner menus. Some of the options are on both menus and others are on one or the other. The pork belly option is on both as they should be. I either love or hate pork belly tacos and these got love. In classic Takito fashion they take an array of ingredients I never would of thought up and turn out some stellar tacos using  made in-house tortillas. In this recipe the tortillas are made with turmeric and the pork belly takes a slow 8 hour braise before becoming crispy on the exterior with a moist and tender interior. Toppings are smoked queso fresco, aji amarillo, pickled jicama, locally grown arugula, and pepitas. They know upscale tacos. Pork Belly Tacos My entree option was steak and eggs. This recipe was a Colombian play on my favorite breakfast plate.

The description on the menu for Kanobo Spice says it's ""face numbing, tear jerking...."" and I couldn't agree more. But it's more out of an unpleasant disgustingly awful taste rather than what they would have you believe. Simply one of the THE MOST RIDICULOUS dishes I've ever eaten at a restaurant.

Though we are both lovers of Asian cuisine, we wanted to switch it up from the usual Thai food we order together. She lives in the West Loop, and had heard of a ramen spot not too far from her apartment. Having gone to college and lived off of ramen noodles, I knew the meal would be much more delicious than any bowl of instant ramen could ever taste, but I was unsure what to expect from real ramen. We decided it would be the perfect meal  to warm us up from the inside out, so we headed out to see what all the fuss was about. The Vibe High Five Ramen is located next door and downstairs from Green Street Smoked Meats, a very cool restaurant in the West Loop with an entrance in an alley off Green Street. High Five Ramen opens at 6:00 PM daily, but my friend had heard that it is very popular and gets crowded quickly, so we showed up 30 minutes early just to be safe. When we arrived, we were told to enter through the door for Smoked Meats, walk through the restaurant, then go through a second door and wait on the stairs until High Five Ramen was open and ready for business. When we arrived at 5:30 we were the third group in line, but within five minutes, the line reached all the way up the stairs and into the restaurant above. While we waited, we grabbed drinks from the central bar at Smoked Meats, as the sign at the bottom of the stairs suggested (see number 2), and sipped our beer until 6:00 rolled around. A hostess came to seat us promptly at 6:00 PM and we got our first peek into the restaurant. What adds to the popularity of High Five Ramen is the intimate atmosphere and limited seating; Patrons sit on stools at two high tables that only can seat about a dozen people at a time, hence the long line and long wait time.

RM Champagne Salon,https://www.zomato.com/chicago/rm-champagne-salon-west-loop/reviews,"Apr 30, 2015",3.5,"“Come quickly, I am tasting the stars!” ~ Dom Perignon, at the moment he discovered champagne.  One hot, dusty evening I round the corner away from the busy bustling restaurant strip, where fancy cars are being valeted in throngs. I walk further and further away from the hustle and bustle of fashionable people jockeying for the best table at one of the hot eateries. There are times when I am in that crowd, looking to taste flavors du jour, but not tonight. It’s been a long day, and I am in search of serenity, cool air and refreshing beverage. In a quiet alley just behind the strip a lovely lady beams at me. “Are you visiting us tonight?” Yes, I am. I am by myself. I don’t have a reservation, is there a spot at the bar? “Of course! You can have any seat you like! Bar or table, inside or outside. Welcome to RM Champagne Salon.”  I am ushered into what I can only imagine heavenly bliss is like. The patio is lovely, but on this hot sticky day, I opt for the coolness of the dimly lit bar. Passing me off to one another, like an Olympic torch, the dazzling crew of hostesses makes sure I am comfortably settled on a bar stool and firmly in bartender’s care. The menus are handed to me, but I can’t quite focus on them. In front of me an oversized silver ice bucket is overflowing with champagne bottles of various origins and sizes. The sight renders me speechless for a moment. This, I think to myself, is what heaven must be like. My version of heaven at least. Champagne for everyone!  I finally look at the menus in front of me. One is a book filled with grower champagnes, the primary focus here, as well as sparkling wines from all over the world. Spanish txakolina shares the spotlight with Italian prosecco and South African bubbly. As I make my way through the menu of sparkling and still wines and savory bites, something catches my eye. Behind the bar bartender produces a magnum of one of my favorite Provencal roses, Chateau Peyrassol. In fact it looks so refreshingly inviting, that I order a glass on the spot. My first sip at a champagne bar isn’t champagne at all. It turns out the place sold out of the regular rose by the glass, and thus the rose lovers have automatically been upgraded to a much more expensive pour, but for the same price. Classy move, RM, I like you already. Impressed, I finish my deliciously crisp glass of rose, order a flute of sparkling and settle in with the food menu.  A single tiny popcorn cream puff arrives with compliments. In fact, the food menu here offers plenty of small bites, sort of an amuse bouche parade, which for me is delightful. I love tasting a variety of things, so being able to order several different noshes is very appealing. The savory bites are curated by the talented Chef Jared Van Camp of neighboring Nellcote. I loved the lobster deviled egg and the cool cobia crudo, but my favorite bite is that of crispy Champagne-battered oysters with bernaise sauce. Flavors and textures dance in my mouth: the crispy against the creamy, the briny against the sweet. It’s exquisite. Dessert bites require their own menu. Chef Nate Meads mignardises list is outstanding. Not being a dessert lover, I still feel compelled to try a generous sampling. The delicately fragile macarons are as good as I have ever had, lemon being my favorite. I try nougat and yuzu St. Tropez (a tiny brioche filled with Japanese citrus scented pastry cream). The hazelnut truffle is dense and intense with earthy hazelnut flavor. But for me a pillowy Grand Marnier marshmallow steals the show. As I close my mouth around it, it lingers for a second and simply disappears, leaving behind a faint whisper of itself. I imagine that is what tasting a cloud would feel like.  As I emerge from my bliss, I become aware of my surroundings. The sommelier is milling about the room and patio looking for a bottle to saber, a feat I would love to witness. Next to me a stylish lady is laying waste to a platter of beautiful oysters. She passes one to me for a taste, I share a glass of my txakolina with her. The ensuing camaraderie results in the perfect stranger picking up my check without my knowledge. It is indeed an evening of surprises. Having stopped in for a glass and a quick look, I spent five hours at RM on a Tuesday night, lingering over dessert. How did that happen? Pure magic. Amazing things take place when I am drinking champagne. It’s like tasting the stars.  {This review was originally published on July 11th, 2014}",Gourmet Rambler,27887829,23554209,DINING

We were told to go to the back and place our order. I ordered a pizza for my 15 year old daughter and myself. I gave the employee $20 for my $19.41 order. I then had him ring up 2 drinks on a separate order. He gave me change and a receipt and I moved back to the front to wait for a seat. After we were seated and we ate our pizza with some friends who ordered 2 pizzas, the bill was all rang up together. My pizza I paid for, was on the bill with the other 2 pizzas my friend ordered. The waiter stated, ""If you paid for your pizza, it would not transfer to the food ticket."" I felt he was calling me a liar. The waiter had taken both ""receipts"" when he went to initially get our pizzas from the back. I then went back to the the young man who rang me up and took my $20. He of course, did not remember me or remember taking my money. Then he got a little blond manager to tell me once again, ""If you did in fact pay for your pizza, which is not typical of us to take money when you order; your pizza would not be on the bill."" So, again, I felt she was assuming I was lying. I truly felt humiliated!!!!!!! I asked the manager to look over the camera footage or have him balance his drawer. She told me that they did not have time. She took my name and phone number down and said, ""I will credited the pizza on this bill, but if the drawer is short I will call you."" Really? If the back ""Ordering department"" does not typically take cash, then why didn't the young man tell me and WHY are there cash drawers in the back AND why did he take my cash? I will NEVER step foot in another Giordano's in Chicago. It will be UNO's or DUO's for us!!!!!

On our cross country trip we stayed in Chicago for a few days and were told that Giordano's was the place to get the best traditional Chicago deep dish pie. While I have absolutely nothing to compare it to (chicago style that is), I can say that I absolutely loved the pepperoni and garlic stuffed pizza that we ordered. The crust was like nothing that I have had before - almost a pastry crust. The crust itself has very little (if any) added flavor but the crisp flakiness accompanies the magnificant sauce and astronimical amounts of amazing mozzerella so well that it did not need to. THE CHEESE on this pizza was EVERYWHERE and it was the bomb diggity! The only thing I would have liked better was if the pepperoni was baked on top. I know that the juices from the meat soak into the cheese and crust when baked underneath the cheese but I prefer my pepperoni to have a little cooked taste to it and it just tastes raw when cooked underneath. Pepperoni is good no matter how it is prepared but that was my only difference in preference and it's pure nitpicking. While I still say that buffalo style pizza (NOT the same as NY style!) is my favorite, Chicago pizza is something I see myself craving over NYC thin/greasy pizza pretty much anyday. Unfortunately, it's not as commonly replicated as it's NYC style counterpart and likely will not be something I can find in Northern, CA.",Jay The FoodFreak,22289821,16096786,DINING

I ordered the artichoke/spinach dip and in minutes it was at our table piping out - oh so good! I highly recommend!  Different drink specials on different nights, this evening Long Island Ice Tea for $7. This was probably the only thing I had that was just ok. Not a large drink, and you could taste more of the mix than the alcohol but for $7 in Chicago, not a bad deal.  Now, the pizza arrives. This thing is huge. Minutes later, I have that first piece put away already. It was so good, I think I ate it a bit too fast. The sauce has got to be one of the best pizza sauces I've tasted. The toppings were plenty, although not over done. The crust had a true - pizza oven taste - that can only be accomplished by serious pizza chefs.  Slice 2, I ate more slowly, dissecting each bite and enjoying the different flavors. By far the best deep dish pizza I've had.  Let me just say, the rest of the pizza was consumed over the next few days and although I was only able to re-heat in a small microwave (staying at a hotel), it tasted almost as delicious as the first night.

While the upper floors of the club are private, the ground level has three restaurants that are open to the public. One of the restaurants that is open to the public is Chicken Shop, which its name suggests, specializes in rotisserie chicken. Chicken Shop is a British import, which serves food far superior than anything I have tasted in London. Beyond the grand chandeliers of the SoHo House lobby, you will find Chicken Shop, a casual eatery with exposed brick and a menu of chicken, burgers, and side dishes. Chicken Shop recently held a contest to create a new burger of their secret menu, and my friend Tek’s Gimme! Gimme! Burger won, and I was invited to a pre-launch party celebrating the menu addition. The Gimme! Gimme! Burger combines all the major food groups: beef, bacon, mushrooms, and mac and cheese. It is just as indulgent and delightful as you may imagine. The burger is on the menu for the rest of the year, so mark your calendar and set aside time to try it while you can. (That’s Tek’s wife, Shai of Drunk on Shoes holding up the burger). I also got to sample several of the other menu items at Chicken Shop. The rotisserie chicken was excellent – it’s really juicy and completely covered in spices. Diners have the option of ordering a half chicken or a whole chicken. I would recommend ordering the whole chicken – it’s addictive and it comes out almost immediately after you order. We tried a bunch of side dishes too. The fries are thick crinkle cut; the kind that are crispy on the outside and soft in the middle. The butter lettuce salad was simply dressed with a mustardy dressing, and it added a much needed vegetable to the table. The macaroni and cheese is very traditional. It reminded me of school cafeteria mac and cheese and I mean that in the best way possible. Chicken Shop is a fun place for a quick and casual meal. The burger is definitely worth checking out. I have been on a burger kick lately. I just tried Umami Burger, and next week I will be sharing a post about Au Cheval. I plan to do some more healthy eating after the holidays.

They do have quite a few veggie options, but our server told that the fried items would be fried in the same deep fryer as everything else, this irked Anand and we didn't get any fried items. We ordered the Vegan Ramen, which was brilliant! It was spicy and tasty and had lots of vegetables. I would definitely go back for this. We also ordered Fire Bean Sprouts (So tasty! Make sure to order this) and Sautéed Bok Choy (I am not a huge fan of Bok Choy, may not order it again). I did get Ramune (traditional Japanese soda, which tasted a little like bubblegum) and Anand got a couple of beers.  It's reasonably priced, and considering how much I loved the ramen, I have no doubt that I will go back here. I definitely recommend!!",Akshatha,379024,30012369,DINING

Pegasus,https://www.zomato.com/chicago/pegasus-greektown/reviews,"Sep 19, 2016",1,"Beware the valet service at Pegasus!  I had the misfortune of dining at Pegasus a few months ago.  The food was unremarkable and we regretted not choosing Greek Islands across the street as we usually do when in town, but the worst part came as we were driving home and discovered several items missing from the car after using their valet!  I called the restaurant but didn't get anywhere.  Eventually I decided to forget about it since the items didn't amount to more than a couple hundred dollars in value - small amount of cash, umbrellas, car charger and cables, sunglasses, etc.  I probably wouldn't have written this review, but after a neighbor heard my story, they told something interesting about their experience at Pegasus.  They had used the valet service and when they asked for the car back the attendant walked straight to the car without going to the key box.  Then the attendant opened the unlocked car and pulled the keys from under the mat!  Everything was in full view since the valet parking is just across the street from restaurant entrance.  My neighbor was shocked and fortunately didn't have anything in the car to be stolen, but how easy would it have been for someone to just take the car!  I think something fishy is going on here.  If anyone else has had a similar experience please respond.  Of course I understand that you have to be careful with any valet service, and I regret being foolish enough to have left some valuables in the car, but leaving cars unlocked with keys in them is just plain inexcusable.  Everyone I have told the story to wonders if the valet didn't have a partner going through the cars.  It's a perfect set up since the restaurant doesn't take responsibility for it.  Also, we didn't discover our items missing until we had left Chicago, but if someone else finds items missing at the Pegasus valet, call the police immediately!  They need to know what is going on to make a record and investigate.  You'll probably never get your stuff back, but if enough attention is brought to the problem, maybe it can be prevented for others.",Bill,36040301,28260864,DINING

The entrees are to die for. But if you’ve never had their burger, try it first...add extra cheese.  Also highly recommended is their house bacon/pork belly or the cow cheek. For a place that prides itself on meets, their salad was excellent. It was quite unique, with a hint of fennel. But could have been a bit larger.

I really tried to not go in with high expectations -  but how can you not when all the talk about the burger and the infamous wait? I could not leave Chicago without trying this burger even though that meant one less Chicago hot dog!  I arrived at 11 am on Monday and I got the last seat at the counter. The place was full with a few people that had a larger group waiting outside.   I ordered the single burger (which is 2 patties) for $11.95 and I went au cheval so added an egg ($1). My appetite at that hour couldn't handle the bacon ($3.50) which is pork belly and not the crispy bacon you're thinking of. It was too much meat for me. Anyhow ordered that and a coke and waited maybe 15 mins. During that time I watched the dozens upon dozens of burgers being churned out.   The moment of truth - the burger was actually more subtle in flavour than I expected. Burger was cooked medium rare to a medium and very juicy. You can taste the beef and it was highlighted by the super thing slices of pickles and the slight tang of the Dijon-mayo sauce. And I always love good the melty salty nature of the American cheese. The bun was also a standout as it stood up to the juices, sauce and perfect cooked sunny side up egg that oozed into a delicious mess. And the side pickle was the perfect level of sour to cut the fat of the burger.   Was it the most amazing burger? It ranks up there for sure. And I would return here to try their other dishes. I finished my burger unlike this girl beside me who ordered a double burger (3 patties) with egg and bacon. I was ready to consider her my hero if she ate the whole thing. She took a million pics like every other person dining there but she only ate half and didn't bag it home. It was thrown out. I was horrified. Know your limits girl.   Service was very friendly.

The first day we were there, we weren’t exactly sure where to eat lunch because we had a lot of meals planned and didn’t want to repeat any of the same type of cuisine. After consulting with you guys on twitter, I was inspired to try Au Cheval (thanks @rachelrubes ). I have always heard good things, but had never gotten around to trying it. It’s on that strip of Randolph Street with so many great places to eat nearby. snack next door It’s one of those no-reservation places, but since we had a late reservation that night, we were fine with waiting the 45 minutes or so we had to wait to get a table. Also, we just walked down the street a bit and had a margarita and some chips and salsas at Hello Tacos. With the time change, we were a little hungry, so this was the perfect compromise. Their house fresh-squeezed margarita was crisp and delicious. And we got a basket of chip with the tomatillo lime salsa and pico de gallo. Both were really tasty (they have 7 different salsa choices). Easy way to kill the time, take a little edge off our hunger and enjoy their outside seating. Au Cheval texted us right when they said they would and we were seated. From everything I read, it is imperative to try the cheeseburger there. We were ordering off of the brunch menu since it was Saturday, but luckily they had the burger ($11.95) on there as well. (Protip: a single is a double here and a double is a triple.) Ours was a “single” and we split it between us. It’s truthfully probably one of the best fat burgers I can remember. (Apparently Bon Appetit agrees , as they named it American’s best burger shortly after the restaurant opened.) It’s very tender beef, not over packed, cooked pleasantly medium, and each patty is topped with American cheese. The thing that pushes it to amazing for me (outside of all the great ingredients) is the sauce they put on top—it’s a Dijonaise sauce with Dijon and mayo, but als",Erin In Indy,22248491,23889473,DINING

Having opened up after its restaurant group's Gilt Bar and Maude's Liquor Bar and before Bavette's, Doughnut Vault, Green Street Smoked Meats, Cocello's and High Five Ramen, Au Cheval Bar & Diner could have a middle child complex - still chugging along and not getting much attention. Yet it manages to keep packing them in with its limited seating, lines out the door, beer and burger. You might be thinking ""eh, show me something new - not worth the hassle."" But it is. We've been the first customers to open the place; we've waited outside; and we've left our cell number, took a walk and still waited in the bar after getting the call to come back. I should mention Mark doesn't wait in line. The no-res thing is a pet peeve of his (and mine now that I think about it), but Au Cheval is the exception.   Let's cut to the food - it's rich. So don't expect to do much after eating here except for unbutton your pants and lie on the couch. As a health coach, there are very few places I go willingly knowing I will endure the agony of food-defeat. We've had the joy of trying the toasted open-faced ham & cheese fondue with fried egg, the crispy fries and mornay sauce with fried egg, the fried house-made bologna sandwich, et al. But the somewhat sensible meal for us is the single (two 4 oz. patties - double has three) burger with cheese, pickles, onions, special sauce and toasted bun. It's got what Mark calls, ""great meat-to-bun ratio"" and what food critics call ""perfection."" Order a side of their standard ridiculous fries with aioli, plus, believe it our not, their simple prep fresh fish. We had salmon the last time and it truly was simple, juicy and memorable.

The Blueberry muffin which is only served on weekends is by far the best blueberry something I have ever had.  They grill it  with a sprinkling of salt on top, so it had that sweet and salty thing goin' on which I love:)   And then, the butter that goes on it just makes this already delectable treat a heavenly experience.    Next up was the burger, bologna sandwich and fries....

The burger at West Loop eatery Au Cheval is legendary (even Barney Stinson would agree). The burger is an experience. It isn’t unusual for entire tables of people to all order the burger, and generally little conversation occurs (other than moans) once the burgers are served. Dining at Au Cheval is Chicago’s version of a When Harry Met Sally Katz’s deli scene. Au Cheval is a sister restaurant to Bavette’s, Cocello, Doughnut Vault, and Green Street Smoked Meats – and based on that fact alone you know Au Cheval is going to live up to the buzz. The thing about Au Cheval is that everyone knows that it is the best, so expect a wait. The only way around the wait is to arrive right when the restaurant opens. Otherwise, you might get lucky if you swing by after 10pm on weeknight. But generally, you should plan to wait for 60-90 minutes. I assure you, the burger is worth the wait. Just go to Lone Wolf next door and have a couple of beers. Au Cheval will text you when your table is ready. Once you get a table, I suggest ordering two things. Start with the crispy fries topped with mornay sauce (that’s the same sauce that goes on mac and cheese) and a sunny side up egg – because you need to go all out at Au Cheval. The fries also come with an aioli, but it is really all about the cheese sauce and the egg yolk. Then you need to order the burger. Yes, there are other wonderful items on Au Cheval’s menu – the foie gras and scrambled eggs is a treat, the chilaquiles (served for brunch and after midnight) are a personal favorite, and Charles is a fan of the English breakfast. But, the first thing anyone needs to try at Au Cheval is the burger – and there is an insider’s secret that you need to know – the single is really a double and the double is really a triple, so order wisely. The burgers come a la carte and you have the option of adding bacon and/or a fried egg. I always add bacon; it’s thick cut and perfectly cooked. It’s some of the best bacon in the city, and if you don’t want it on your burger, or if you just want lots of bacon, you can get a side of bacon. The burger itself consists of two or three thin juicy beef patties layered with cheese and topped with pickles and dijonnaise . I have tried many of the burgers in Chicago, and Au Cheval’s is hands down the best. It’s beefy, juicy, cheesy perfection.",Kit Graham,27459907,23429834,DINING

The dish began with house made tortilla chips, topped with soft scrambled eggs and a generous covering of melted white cheddar cheese. Next came a layer of alternating dollops of sour cream and to-die-for guacamole. This was topped with paper-thin slices of fresh jalapeno and a generous covering of cool, fresh cilantro. The chilaquiles are served with a gravy dish of warm, spicy salsa that you pour over the top.

The emphasis is on quality ingredients, humanely raised, hormone free, and their beef supplier is Creekstone Farms of Kansas, which I personally believe now deserves the crown of the best burger supplier in America, bar none. You can add a choice of three different Wisconsin cheeses, nitrate free bacon, and condiments of your choice.  Fresh cut thick fries with sea salt are available solo or in a combo. Buns are baked fresh daily, the establishment uses real butter, cage free eggs, and the burger produce tastes like you grew it yourself. The patties are amply-sized, have a nice little char crust and are obviously (note pic) hand-formed.

Princi,https://www.zomato.com/chicago/parlor-pizza-bar-west-loop/reviews,"Sep 19, 2019",1,"This is a review on the hospitality group, management, and restaurant as a whole. This group used to own Stout until they started Parlor, and have done really well. However, at Stout a little over a year ago a bus boy dumped a full plate of buffalo wings all over me. At the time, I was compensated with a 20% lifetime discount card to all of their restaurant group places, including Parlor. However, a little over a month ago my wallet was stolen including the discount card.  I've never had a problem using this card. And I loved the way the problem was handled so much that I have recommended Stout and Parlor on a number of occasions. Now after I asked for the card with my unfortunate situation with the stolen wallet, I was actually berated by Parlor's Director of Operations for bullying and threatening them. A completely unacceptable response to a person who is trying to recover lost items just like a credit card or ID.  Parlor is clearly thriving in Chicago. However, I think their management will take awhile to evolve to the level of professionalism that companies like Lettuce Entertain You or Levy Restaurants have achieved by having exceptional customer service.",Steve Christians,140302411,45150563,DINING

For that reason, I do enjoy this place. It's a great place to go watch sports with friends, with an awesome outdoor area. The pizza is hit or miss for me, which is one of the reasons I have a hard time rating this place highly. I have tried 5 of them so far: 2 mediocre (Abe Forman's Fave & Margherita), 2 good (Burrata Be Kiddin Me & Salmon Cream Cheese brunch pizza), 1 great (Brussel Shuffle). The one food item that I'd say is a must order (and really the one I'd come back for) is the Nacho Bites appetizer. They spread about 10 homemade tortilla chips around a tray, and dress each individually with beans, bbq pork, cheese, chipotle mayo, etc. Super flavorful and I can appreciate the effort put into making them!

Alhambra Palace Restaurant,https://www.zomato.com/chicago/alhambra-palace-west-loop/reviews,"Feb 16, 2009",0,"Huge Disappointment. Me and my boyfriend went to Alhambra On Valentine’s day. I’ve made reservations a week before for 9:30PM. When we arrived we were waiting  about 30 min to be seated which was fine with us since we grabbed a glass of wine and enjoyed the atmosphere… We were seated at a table with a pretty good view to the stage and came right on time to catch the belly dancer  show which was excellent.  45 minutes later - the belly dancer has finished her performance - we still haven’t been greeted !!! Good thing we still had the whine glasses from the bar which were done by then. Still in an optimistic mood- we asked the busboy to find our server . Finally an hour later a server came to our table and took our pre-set 5 course meal order ($105 per person!!!) As for the appetizers - The  tinniest sampler of hummus and babaganush  - were served w/o pita bread and were ridiculously small. We asked two different people (since our server was nowhere to be found) to get us some pita bread - without any success but by that time we were soooooooooooooo hungry that we just ate it without the pita.  The only thing that came out in a reasonable time to the table is our whine refills. Other then that it took FOREVER for ALL the courses to be served.  The food was ok but the service was awful!!! In fact it was so bad that we saw 2 different couples from the tables next to us just get up and leave!!!  When I asked for a hot tea towards the end of my entrée to be served with our dessert  , again - 40 minutes later our server came back to me and said they are out of hot water and I’ll have to wait  again…..  By the time we finished our desert and the only thing we wanted to do is get the hell out of there - my tea has arrived J I’ve worked as a server in a restaurant not too long ago , and trust me… I KNOW how it is when its packed and everyone is running around like crazy trying to get everything out for their table, and I perfectly aware that on a busy night its absolutely impossible to get 100% good service sometimes not even 50% - which would be perfectly fine with me but 1%??? For a $225.00 bill??? That is just unheard of! I’ve always tipped 20% or more from the bill in every restaurant I went to- even if the service wasn’t that great , but this time I just couldn’t get my self to leave $50 tip for the most terrible service!!! Our plan was to spend a wonderful romantic night in a fancy restaurant and maybe continue our night at the upstairs dance floor or a different club , but at 12:30 when we finally finished dinner - the only thing we wanted to do is forget about that night and the $250 we threw away in Alhambra - the Moroccan palace….",Julia,20785749,16118041,DINING

Food was either prepared ahead of time or returned by a previous table (which is what we should have done).  You can getter better hummus at Dominicks.  Fun continued into bar.  Completely ignored by 4 managers and 2 bartenders…all equally untrained and unprofessional.  One drink order took as long to serve as a 4 course meal.  Bartender got into an argument with me about a wine I just had a dinner...said it didn't exist until I asked him for the wine list and showed him!  Table next to us was just as frustrated.

I've been several times and there are a few consistencies that have made this the last time I'll ever go back.  There is only one shining star at Blue Agave and that's Emale.  You can typically find him behind the bar serving up some of the best drinks.  He is the most attentive and on-top-of-it person on staff.  For all of the other experiences with other servers, including today, the experience hasn't gone so well.  The restaurant never really seems to even approach half capacity yet the service lags.  Every time I have been there I have explained to the server that I am vegan and that means no animal products.  On this particular visit the server acted like she completely understood and guided me through a selection of side items that I wanted.  She steered me clear of the refried beans and recommended the black beans.   Glasses sat empty for a while before refills came and with hot salsa on the table it couldn't have come soon enough.  When the food arrived everything was correct except the black beans had cheese crumbled all over the top.  The same server that I ordered them from acted surprised that I could not eat the cheese.  She even asked me if I couldn't have the cheese.  She was gracious and took the beans back to the kitchen for a remake.  It wasn't a horribly long time for the dish to come back out correct and all was well after that.  The ambiance in the restaurant is much like what you would see at an all-inclusive resort in Mexico.  For us, the louder than expected music diminishes conversation.  Overall, Blue Agave rates pretty low because of the consistent lack of service and the guaranteed fact that in each experience something from our table (non-vegan and vegan alike) has had to return to the kitchen for correction.  Additionally, the lack of awareness on the staff's part of dietary restrictions and working with special orders lands B.A. two stars.  At two stars, I do not recommend this restaurant to family or friends and we won't return.",El Bee,20924173,24531077,DINING

The burgers here at Shake Shack are delicious but the prices are similar to Five Guys. 2 burgers and 2 shakes cost me $25. It took me 8 bites to eat the whole burger. I'm not sure why they charge so much, but I just don't think it's worth it. The service was ok, but this location is fairly new and they have some kinks to work out.

Rather than the kitschy/cheesy representation of the decade that usually dominates themed restaurants and bars, we found a surprisingly elegant, but still funky and fun version of the 1970s behind its brass door (yes, it seems like a bit of oxymoron to equate elegance with the '70s, but trust me on this one). The '70s-inspired restaurant offers a unique dining experience with two distinct menus: diners can choose from the Brasserie menu, featuring French-inspired fare or the Hits of the '70s menu, featuring a contemporary take on '70s classics. During our dinner, we had the chance to sample dishes from both menus - while there were some definite standouts from the Brasserie menu (the Skuna Bay Salmon and Spanish Calamari Salad in particular), let's be honest, we were most excited about the classics from the '70s side. I mean how can you take a trip back to the '70s and not partake in the retro dishes?! The front of the restaurant contains a room filled with boxes of vinyl - diners can flip through the hundreds of options (rock, jazz, blues, pop - pretty much every genre is covered!) and pick albums to listen to on the provided record players/headsets.

Otoro, chutoro at $10 a pop were dead center, and sounded expensive for one piece of nigiri sushi at $10 but oh. my. goodness... It was worth every penny. I called otoro or super fatty tuna belly the bacon of the sea. It was so exquisite and just soooooo damm good.  It was pretty cool to see items like mentaike spaghetti and uni cawan mushi. That spaghetti was explosion of flavor and I was deliriously in love with a pasta dish at a Japanese restaurant. Cawan mushi was a savory egg custard, and it was made super smooth in texture with this smokiness of charred uni that also gave the intense flavor of the sea and paired with these roes that popped in your mouth.

Okay, pretty much everything is a must order but as the menu is so big you’ll have the perfect excuse to come back to Momotaro again and again.",Alicia Lauhon,29337318,23682377,DINING

Ciao! Cafe & Wine Lounge,https://www.zomato.com/chicago/cafe-ciao-west-loop/reviews,"Mar 10, 2014",0,"""I didn't write the voucher"". So I'll start out with the positives. The food was very good and the ambiance was inviting. We ordered several things on the menu, I had the rigatoni, it was delicious. We were also surprised when we found out they had live music coming in later in the evening and the restaurant owner personally came out and invited us to stay to listen to the music. Up until the end, I would have given this place 4.5 stars, perhaps even 5....   The reason for only 2 stars... the service wasn't great. In fact, at points, our server was downright rude. I purchased a Travelzoo voucher for Cafe Ciao. My party of 4 had never been there before and the voucher sounded like quite the deal and reason enough to venture out of our neighborhood during a cold Chicago winter... the voucher read as follows:   - For $20 (reg. $40) sample anything on the menu. - We recommend a starter such as the ""eclectic"" small plates and two entrees such as the house specialty rigatoni all rigo - Or pair two entrees with two glasses of wine from the cafe's ""respectable"" list. - For $30 (reg. $60), dine with a party of four and save even more.   Now, the fine print reads that anything additional that exceeds the vouchers value is the guests responsibility.... totally fair. Now, if you read that description, doesn't it sound like you get two entrees and two glasses of wine for $20 (regularly $40)? That was how I read it... So we get to the restaurant on Friday night, and I tell our server that we had the travelzoo voucher and I asked him if I understood the voucher correctly, that we each pick one glass of wine and one entree (we purchased the voucher for 4 people). He said yes, that was the deal, and then as we all ordered the same kind of wine, he suggested a bottle and we asked if that was included in the deal and he said yes. So, under the impression that we could each order an entree and a glass of wine for $30 (which yes, does seem too good to be true, but that is what the voucher said, no?) we ordered an appetizer and a second bottle of wine, assuming that would be the only cost on our bill after the voucher was redeemed. We were surprised when our bill came to $150, after the voucher... so we asked for clarification on the bill as we were under the impression that 4 entrees and 4 glasses of wine would be covered under the terms of the voucher. Our ever so professional and kind server (note sarcasm) redeemed the voucher, I asked him to read it and tell me if I was in fact reading it wrong.... his response, ""I didnt' write the voucher""... and that was that. Excuse me, I don't care who wrote the voucher, Cafe Ciao approved the voucher.... Cafe Ciao is the host of the voucher.... therefore, Cafe Ciao is responsible for the voucher... all of which I said to him. So after our server essentially tried to make me feel like and idiot, he took our money, did not offer any sort of apology for the misleading voucher, and stood behind the bar and talked about us (it is a very small place, you can hear, not to mention see him and his friend looking at us). Then as we finished our wine, he never came back to see if we needed anything else, which I did. At first I was also surprised that they added gratuity for a party of four... but now I can see why.... with service that poor, they are probably worried they would get no tip at all.  I will not be back, which is unfortunate, because I did like the food.",Kristin.hylek,24403000,16089733,DINING
