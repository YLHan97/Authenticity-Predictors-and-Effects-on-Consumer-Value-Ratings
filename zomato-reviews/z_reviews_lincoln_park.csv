The staff is incredibly friendly, and always put a smile on my face. While I took my cupcakes to go the majority of the time, the inside of their shop is super cute! It has a laid-back coffee shop vibe with lots of smaller tables and benches. Every time I walked by people were sitting enjoying their coffee and cupcakes no matter what time of day.

Molly's Cupcakes,https://www.zomato.com/chicago/mollys-cupcakes-lincoln-park/reviews,"Mar 21, 2013",2,"Molly's Left Me Speechless. Where to start...  To make a long story short: My husband and I went to Molly's for the first time recently, we had a negative first experience. The store was busy, they didn't have time to answer our questions, the girl behind the cupcake counter had a rotten attitude so we said, ""Ok, no big deal, they're busy, we'll try back again another time."" So we just went with a berry cupcake and took it home with us. (The girl at the register, fyi, had a great attitude. She should have been serving the customers the cupcakes.)  So a couple days later I went back. I went out of my way on a Monday evening to travel from the suburbs by public transit just to get my family some of these cupcakes everyone is raving about. After my 3 + hour commute, I was really looking forward to some great customer service at Molly's. I walked in the store, and I was the only one there in line! I went right to the counter eager to ask all kinds of questions about the cupcakes, and I had the same girl who just simply said, ""Do you know what you want?"" I was attempting to ask my questions, with the girl at the counter just looking annoyed, not answering me, then some customers came in behind me. I didn't want to take up anyone's time, but at the same time my questions weren't being answered. The girl behind the counter curtly said, ""we do make them how you want them. if you don't know what you want step aside and let the other customers order."" Not wanting to hold up the line, I just quickly ordered the mix and match cupcakes (vanilla cake, chocolate frosting) and a few others. She rushed me over to the register and I said calmly, ""Oh, please make sure you put alot of frosting on."" I'm not sure if she heard me, but the line was piling up behind me for people to pay, so I didn't worry about it. I trusted the cupcakes would be worth it. The girl hands me the box, and I had to ask for a bag, which was a problem seeing that she rolled her eyes when I asked for a bag. I said, ""I'm sorry to bother you for a bag, but I have to take 2 buses and 2 trains with these cupcakes.""   So far, I felt like I was just a bother to the employees, and definitely not a welcome customer. The people in there behind me were regulars, they didn't have any questions, which seems to make the process easier, understandably, but this is a service business, so there needs to be good customer service.  NOW, I got home after my long train ride, greeted my husband and son with the box of cupcakes we had all been looking forward to (I hadn't opened them at this point.) When I opened them the order was entirely wrong. I asked for specific pairings of cake and frosting, half of the cupcakes had literally a 1.5 inch diameter x 4mm height of frosting on them. My son looked at them and said, ""that's it?"" We're all too familiar with the massive amount of frosting Magnolia, Crumbs, and Sprinkles. (The customer service we have received at the mentioned cupcake bakeries was great, by the way, despite how busy these places get.)  I emailed info@mollyscupcakes.com and had a useless discussion with the GM. I won't name anyone, but this general manager showed absolutely zero understanding that they messed up my cupcakes, and the attitudes were terrible. She didn't even offer to replace them. She spent all her time in the emails back and forth being defensive, saying, ""oh, I'll look into it, surely this can't be possible, we don't receive *any* complaints as you can see from our reviews."" I then responded, ""It is very possible as with many customers who've had bad experiences that many don't bother to take the time to write a letter about it or discuss the issue. Instead people who've had bad experiences just end up telling their friends about it.""   So as of now, I'm awaiting a response from the GM of Molly's. She could have really mended this situation, but she just steered me in the opposite direction, I couldn't run any faster from this place. I will stick to the many other cupcake bakeries in the city and burbs that offer great cakes made correctly AND great customer service.  My husband and I will be sure to tell our friends to stay away. My husband buys pastries and such for his employees bi-weekly, so we're always looking for new places to buy large quantities of pastries/cupcakes from. My husband mentioned this to her by email, and she told him, ""that's your loss, Mr. M***."" My husband was just speechless when he read me the email over the phone.  UPDATED 3/20 at 10:55pm: G***, the General Manager, has emailed me back a verbally abusive letter! If anyone would like to see the email, please contact me through Yelp and I'll be happy to inform you of the terrible service here. She made it clear she's not going to resolve the situation due to the ""Yelp"" & ""UrbanSpoon"" review. WoW. What kind of people do they hire for upper management? High School graduates? Her wording was that of a high schooler. I take her words with a grain of salt. $14 loss, oh well.",Deb M,23587226,16119424,DINING

Boka Restaurant,https://www.zomato.com/chicago/boka-lincoln-park/reviews,"Sep 01, 2015",5,"Being right next door to Alinea, Boka has a lot to prove. Having a Michelin star though is truly a testament to how great dining here can be. In fact, it's kind of a big deal. The chef at Boka, Chef Lee Wollen, has a long credentials, which really intrigued me in trying his food. He had worked a long time at Eleven, the reigning #1 restaurant in the US and #3 in the world, as well as El Bulli. Whoa. What about that, Grant Achatz? :)  At times, I really don't care who the chef is as long as the food is good. However, there are times when credentials and accomplishments definitely need to be given credit, such as this one. It definitely showed  in the dishes.  The restaurant is fancy like a fancy restaurant should be. It had a little terrace before you went in and the hostess with a big smile opened the door for you and before you knew it, you were seated. There were people in really dressy evening outfits, and there were us dressing towards the casual side. The crowd was definitely mixed.  They started us with pea soup with olive oil, a gift from the chef. It was in a sake cup to sip. It was clean, cold, and really started the palate lightly but surely. I ordered the spicy garlic soup with peekytoe crab, mustard, and caraway seeds. Oh my God...it was silky garlicky kill vampire perfection. It was so so so good.   My friends got the brandade ravioli with artichoke, lemon, and sorel in a foamy broth as well as the grilled spanish octopus with eggplant, rhubarb, and sesame. Ravioli was exquisite and so delicate. The octopus....mh, it was unbelievable! The chunks made me believe it was a giant octopus. They were huge! They were thumb size and they were so tender and beautifully prepared. We actually ordered another plate to share!  For entrée, I went with short ribs with tongue, morels, and ramps. I really wanted fish but my friend, Evi, called the poached cod with razor clam first. The other fish was trout, which I hate. Therefore, I chose the morels and ramps with the short ribs. My friend, Sabrina, went for the Pekin duck breast with turnip and black garlic. Mine was so delicious. The rib was cooked like steak and there was a mousse on the plate that tasted like a liver mousse and a couple other chunks of meat that might have been tongue? I really didn't examined but they were so darn amazing. The cod was covered in another foamy liquid and it seemed Evi had a foamy theme tonight. The duck was actually my favorite. Between the crispy skin and the medium rare breast..oh it was just flavor and texture all over the place and I just loved that duck breast in my mouth. My friend Nate is a vegetarian and he ordered the broccoli dish and he said it was good but salty.   My least favorite part was dessert. We ordered two and the coffee and hazelnut praline with whole milk ice cream was definitely the better one. The caramel roasted banana was not a winning dessert at our table. The banana was weird. However, they gave us more desserts of handmade truffles.   The service was impeccable as it would be and it was more easy going and personable. There was little to none stuffiness with the staff and they catered to you instead of telling patrons ""this is how we do it here"" like most restaurants this caliber would do.   The portion was huge too and it was another surprising thing. We already planned for second session at String Ramen down the road but we axed that as we were absolutely stuffed. Plus, the price wasn't bad. I had a cocktail and a three course meal and I paid less than a hundred with tip. Let's just say that was 1/6 of what I paid next door at Alinea, granted there were more courses and booze.  It was a great time and we had a lot of fun at Boka. The food itself was the star and knowing how we love the other creation of Boehm and Katz, Momotaro, we were not at all surprised of how great Boka was.

Chicago Pizza & Oven Grinder,https://www.zomato.com/chicago/chicago-pizza-oven-grinder-company-lincoln-park/reviews,"Jun 12, 2016",4,"My Chicago visit would have been incomplete if I would have missed out on this place. So during my research about the city,I had come across this restaurant's name multiple times,and obviously my curiosity got the better of me and eventually wanted to badly check this place out (and it was a very good decision).  First of all, starting with the location, its like 10 mins walk from Lincoln park zoo. When my 2 friends and I reached there for dinner around 4 pm ,we were greeted by this huge crowd of people waiting to get inside,with a glass of beer or other drinks in their hands. We somehow managed to enter inside and saw another tiny queue of people. It took us some time to figure out that we need to speak to the manager first and tell him the number of people for the table. It was fascinating to see that the manager remembered the faces of the people waiting,the number of people accompanying and the amount of time they've waited,without taking a note of it anywhere! Such an awesome memory. So he later told us that we have to wait atleast an hour and 15 minutes for a table. We were tempted to give up and move to other nearby restaurants,but my curiosity kept me going and I somehow convinced my friends to stay put and wait. Finally after like 1.5 hr of sheer boredom and what felt like eternity ,the manager called us inside and took us to our table.  So the restaurant is pretty dingy and REALLY congested (for a second I felt as if I am in some restaurant in Mumbai). The place is not very decked up, minimal decor,but that should be least of the concerns. So finally the menu arrived,my friends and I shamelessly peeped onto other tables nearby and asked the waiter (who was this really good looking guy) as to what the people were eating. So we ordered for the Mediterranean bread first, then for one pounder pizza pot pie. The bread took around 15 mins to arrive,we were already dying due to hunger by then, but the size of the bread amazed us (and it was really delicious, very buttery and soft,like some kind of naan with cilantro). We were confused whether to go for 3 half pounders or one full pounder,because we didn't have any idea regarding the size,but one pounder seemed to be more logical because the bread was pretty big too. The pot pie pizza took half an hr to be made,but trust me,its totally worth the wait. So the waiter explained how the pie was made and later demonstrated how to serve it and I can't really explain as to how mesmerizing the procedure looked (complete with melted cheese falling on the top of the pie,just like the fast food advertisements). When he left,we didn't waste a moment and just dug in, and that moment we felt infinite XD it tasted like something I can't explain in words,you have to eat it to know the feeling.  We were pretty content and were on the verge to leave,but as usual, my dinner is never complete without a dessert, so we ordered for the only dessert option which they had 'tortoni'. It took another 20 minutes to arrive,and its one of the most heavenly ice creams I've had. It had a rich taste of rum (which isn't real,but just a flavouring) and condensed milk (basically like kulfi rasmalai with rum). It's a dark horse which isn't very talked about since the restaurant is popular for its pot pie,but do try it,you won't regret it :) so finally after eating so much,the bill was for around 60$ (carry cash with you,since they don't accept cards).  We finally left the place around 8:30, fat and content. DO NOT MISS IT!",Gastronaut,15598006,27341909,DINING

The food was worth the wait. They have a limited menu. We ordered a pizza pot pie, mediterranean bread and the tortini dessert.  The pot pie they call it is a pizza dish cooked in a pot unlike the traditional flat pizzas. The sight of this pot pie being served is a trick to watch. The pie is quite different with a lot of gooey cheese with the meaty ingredients inside.  They also customize the ingredients on request.  The best dish for me was the mediterranean bread. This is a huge bread with mediterranean seasoning in generous amounts over the olive oil smeared on the bread. The bread is big and overflows from the plate it served on. This is one dish you dont want to miss out. The frozen ice cream dessert called tortini was quite yummy and helped us finish off the meal.

Whaddayamean they don’t serve pizza? It says it right there on the sign – “Chicago Pizza Oven and Grinder Company”!  As Andy Griffith might have said, “What it was, was a pizza pot pie...”  Yep, that’s probably everyone’s first response when they open the two-page menu that features just one pizza-“like” offering – in “half-pounder” and “one-pounder” sizes- and a handful of hot sandwiches, known here as “grinders”.   Since 1972, this place has been serving what I would call an “inverted pizza”; a steaming, bubbling caldron of pizza ingredients-in-a-cup, brought tableside on ceramic plates dating to the Paleolithic Era, and masterfully flipped by the waiter into a bowl of dense dough.  Billed as “made from scratch”, this pizza-in-a-bread bowl features a chewy dough and mild tomato sauce seasoned with olive oil, fresh garlic, onions and green peppers. The pot pie, once turned upside down, is capped with a thick cheese covering that requires deft knife skills to pry open.  A “half-pounder” is certainly enough for the average person, especially when you trick it out with the only two options offered; sausage and/or mushrooms. Sorry, no pepperoni, sausage or anchovies – kinda like ketchup on a Chicago hot dog, so don’t even ask. And at $11.75 a bowl, it’s a deal – the full-pounder is priced at $23.50.  The grinder sandwiches are also massive, arriving on 10-inch loaves of crusty bread and packed, tip-to-tail with filling options including; Italian ham, meatballs, sausage and, my favorite, The Vegetarian which arrives by fork lift and is loaded with onions, olives, mushrooms, red and green peppers, Romano cheese, garlic oil and spices, all topped with a massive brick of melty Swiss cheese and bubbling tomato sauce. Cut it once, cut it twice, this is a cuppa-two, or tree person sandwich.  Also worth noting are their humongous salads which are truly the size of newborn infants. You can easily feed four adults, or an entire pee-wee soccer team, with just one of these tomato-wrapped cornucopias of veggies and meat. Choose from the Country French, the Classic Greek and the Great American, from $13- $25.  The place is almost always packed after 5pm, and the traffic pattern is very dis-feng shui – basically a one-way route down a long and narrow, 1970’s wood-sided corridor of booths to the left and larger tables to the right.

For our last night in Chicago we decided to head out with some friends. I had read some reviews about Riccardo Trattoria and they had some real winners on the menu. We called for a reservation late on a Sunday afternoon and they were able to squeeze us in.  We were impressed by the decor when we arrived - it's a nice looking restaurant and very cozy, as I believe one reviewer mentioned recently, and we were seated right away.   The menu is great. Very diverse, with dishes from all over Italy. We were also surprised by how reasonable the prices were. Compared with everywhere else we ate in Chicago the entrees were perhaps 1/2 the price. That's generally not a driving factor for us when dining, but I didn't mind paying a little less for a good meal.  One of my friends was impressed with the wine list as well and I concurred. It's a solid list and reasonably priced. (There's the price word again... Last time, I promise)  So four our table of four we had four appetizers - I had the carpaccio, one friend had mussels in garlic, another friend had some clams casino and my wife had an artichoke special that was kind of like an artichoke souffle. All were excellent. I love a good carpaccio and this did not dissapoint in the least. I really liked the mussels as well. Everyone was very happy. We also really loved the fresh italian bread, which was used to sop up the garlic/butter sauce from the mussels. Delicious!  I was really excited for the entrees though. My wife had been craving spaghetti carbonara done the 'true' way with the egg and eagerly ordered that. I ordered the osso buco with risotto. The friend who had ordered the mussels ordered the cioppini which is a shellfish stew and the other friend had veal. I can't recall the specific dish he ordered, but it looked great and he consumed it with gusto.  I greatly enjoyed my osso buco. It was flavorful and tender and just left me wanting more. The risotto was also very good. My wife loved her carbonara. It's a simple dish, but very satisfying when done right and this really was. I think the winner was the cioppini - a ton of fresh shellfish in a tasty broth. Suffice it to say that another loaf of Italian bread was requested.  All in all it was an excellent way to end our trip to Chicago.",John,22065183,16110163,DINING
riccardo trattoria,https://www.zomato.com/chicago/riccardo-trattoria-lincoln-park/reviews,"May 08, 2014",2,"Didn't even stay to eat.. TL;DR: Get a reservation. If you can't, don't bother.   I was trying to find a great Italian place for my boyfriend's birthday, and a Chicago native coworker recommended Riccardo Trattoria. He's always got great taste in restaurants, so we decided to take his advice and try it. There weren't any Open Table slots left between 5:00 (still at work, duh) and 9:00 (gonna die of hunger, duh), but it was a Wednesday, so we thought we'd just wing it. How busy could it be?   I got there at about 6:15, and I was right, it wasn't busy at all. It's a fairly small place, but still, *maybe* a third of the tables were filled. Still, when I asked, they told me that they could give me a table, but only if I promised to be out by 7:30, because they had people with reservations coming then.   I mean, seriously? I'm pretty sure I've heard jokes about crap like that in sitcoms set in New York in the 90s. I didn't think that kind of thing actually HAPPENED. It was as though not having a reservation meant we weren't worth as much as customers--even though we were planning on spending quite a bit, since it was a birthday dinner. Still, I thought it'd be pretty much unenforceable when it came down to it, and I was already starving. Plus, we've successfully eaten dinner in an hour and fifteen minutes before, and sometimes not even on purpose. So I took the table.   I feel that it's relevant at this point to note that they gave me my pick of two-tops, since they had several available. Even though they were such a hot commodity.  When my boyfriend got there, though, it was 6:30 and the only person who'd even glanced in my direction was the busboy who brought me water. You'd think that, if they were in such a hurry to get us in and out, they'd have let me order a drink while I waited. Understandably, he wasn't thrilled with the idea of being rushed through his birthday dinner, so he called over the host to clarify. I really hadn't thought they'd stick to it, but the host confirmed, yeah, we're gonna need you out of here by 7:30. (Implication: For real paying customers who booked in advance.) So we simplified things for them and left right then.   Now, I sort of get where they were coming from. We look young (he's a babyfaced 31, as of yesterday, and I just turned 25), so maybe they assumed we were just going to split an entree with water to drink. The fact that we hadn't managed to get a reservation probably made them think we weren't ready to spend Real Money, too. But filling an otherwise empty table, even with cheapskates, is better than keeping it empty. Flat-out telling us that they'd only tolerate us until the real customers arrived? Pretty rude.   We ended up at Topo Gigio, which was quite tasty.",Erin,21509068,16110160,DINING

I like that. Tucked into a charming location on Clark right by Lincoln Park, Riccardo Trattoria has built a reputation for quality, authentic Italian food without gimmicks.

We shared the Malnalti salad, but had the olives on the side (I can't stand them). I was very glad we did, because after the wait, I was starving so the salad and the complimentary bread was needed. The crumbled Volpi salami was a little too hard and crunchy for my taste, but the mushrooms and tomatos were very fresh and the dressing was flavorful, but not overpowering. I would recommend the salad, but if you have sensitive teeth, skip the salami.   We ordered the pepperoni deep dish pizza and added mushrooms and sliced tomatos. I loved the sauce and thought the extra tomatos were a welcome and flavorful addition, but my mom wished she woudn't have ordered them since the sauce was pretty chunky already. Again, the mushrooms were great, but it could have used more pepperoni as it was hard to find any on many slices.

Goose Island Brewhouse,https://www.zomato.com/chicago/goose-island-brewpub-lincoln-park/reviews,"Jun 14, 2012",0,"Fine Food, Horrible Service. I just got home from Goose Island Clybourn, and I have to say that this is only the second time I have been so bothered by a bar or restaurant that I have felt the need to warn others not to go there. Based on other reviews I have read, it seems that there might be one waitress, in particular, who works there and has given others the same unacceptable service. (I really hope for Goose Island's sake that there aren't multiple waitresses there with the same bad-for-business service problems.) When our waitress took our orders, she wasn't particularly friendly, but I figured that maybe she was the type of person who is very focused on making sure to get everyone's order down quickly. Unfortunately, after she took my order, she swiftly turned and walked away before my friend could ask if he could tweak his order. I was then told by the table that before I got there, she didn't seem particularly interested in attending to our table, which the others found confusing, since we were a large group.  When we got our food, most of us agreed that it was pretty good. I bought the veggie burger item with sweet potato fries, and I was pleased enough with my own food. I felt that the price was a bit steep for the quantity and quality, though. I did not order any beer, since I'm not a beer guy, but the rest of the people at the table seemed to enjoy theirs quite a bit. She did come come check on us once when we were eating, but she did not ask about the food. When she talked to us, she made almost no eye contact, spoke very softly, and seemed irritated and disinterested. I assumed she was going to check with both halves of the table, since she turned away from my side when she asked if anyone needed more to drink. I had to grab her attention as she took off so that I could make sure that I'd have something to drink with the other half of my meal. She came back to check on us again around an hour or so after we had ordered our food, and one of my friends asked if there were any ""birthday desserts"" because we were there celebrating a friend's birthday. The waitress grumbled that they do have one, but that the kitchen was closed, seeming irritated that we didn't know that. (We did not see this advertised on the menu, and the door merely said what time the place opens every day.) She then left in one of her now-signature huffs.  We paid the bill and were later told (around 11:10 PM) that they were closed. The man who told us wasn't particularly friendly about it, but he was nowhere near as unfriendly as the waitress. While one of my friends and i were waiting to use the bathroom, we checked online to see if we could find a closing time for Goose Island. I saw closing times of 10 PM, midnight, and 1 AM listed for Wednesday nights. It does seem convenient that there is no closing time listed on the door, making it easier to decide to close whenever the employees want to get rid of customers. On the other hand, if their closing time really was 10 PM, someone could have told us and we would have promptly wrapped everything up and left. As someone who used to work at the Borders bookstores, I know what it's like to be at work late and be irritated by customers who won't leave. I feel bad if those workers felt like they were stuck at work for an unusual amount of time because of us, but I don't feel *too* bad because they could have politely let us know of their closing time and did not.  In summary, the beer was enjoyed, the food arrived in a timely manner and was good (but a bit pricey), and the only way the waitress could have been worse is if she had messed up our orders or fought with us. Perhaps there are other waiters and waitresses who are great there, but the one we had tonight definitely belongs on the list of the top 5 worst waiters/waitresses I have ever dealt with in my life. (I don't remember her name, but she had curly brown hair.) Like I said, I have worked a service job before, and I know how hard it can be to work a long closing shift. Sometimes, you have a really bad day and it's hard to go in and do your job. Unfortunately, you still have to work hard and be pleasant. I don't think she could have asked for a nicer large group tonight, yet she treated us like we had all ruined her day by coming into Goose Island Clybourn. If she is like this with any kind of frequency, then she must be seriously hurting their business. I know I can't see myself returning any time in the near future.",Garrett,22896521,16097419,DINING

When we arrived around 11:00, we were shocked to find that the line to get in was 60-90 minutes long! We both agreed it was pointless to stand in that line and waste our day away, so we decided to head back down Michigan Ave and grab lunch at Giordano's Pizza. Giordano's was recommended to us by my good friend. Giordano's Pizza 130 East Randoph St When we arrived, we were told it would be a 20 minute wait before we were seated, but that we could place our order right then and that would lessen the time to get our food once we were seated.

The food and service here were above average on my visit, but I have to complain about the inflexibility of this restaurant on their fixed-price menu. My husband is allergic to fish and shellfish and they flat-out refuse to make any changes to their set menu for people with food allergies (when we made the reservation we warned them about the issue). They claim that it is because some of the dishes on the menu, even those that aren't fish, are made with stocks and sauces that may contain fish elements. Ok - first of all, why are some of the non-fish dishes on the set menu made with fishy stocks and yet none of the non-fish dishes on the regular menu are made with these same ingredients? These seems a little odd. Second, I don't mean to get uppity here but I have dined in some of the nicest restaurants in the world (Fat Duck, French Laundry and Alinea for example) and never once have we been told that the chef could not change the menu to accommodate allergies.  So my question is - why does the chef at North Pond, which by the way is nowhere in the same league as the restaurants mentioned above, refuse to make accommodations for diners who WANT to spend money at his establishment?

Here's what I wound up with: Natural & Local House Blend Beef with Chicago Steakhouse spice blend on a Split Top Butter Egg bun with American Cheese, Lettuce, Bread & Butter Pickles, Yellow Mustard, Mayo, and Ketchup – $9.35. Medium-rare. I paid almost $10 for a single burger. Question is, was it $10 good? It was a lot of burger, made with exceptional ingredients. Ten dollars will by you a Double Quarter Pounder with Cheese Meal, plus a McFlurry. Or it will buy you the burger of kick-ass perfection and you get to bring your own beer (because it's BYOB).

Photo courtesy of The Door The glass enclosed section of the bar gives guests the feeling of being inside a living snow globe during the winter, but on warm summer nights, it can be pulled back so that guests can fully enjoy the city-scape below.  ""It's quite a brilliant set up, I must say,"" Brandy said when she attended a preview of the space last week, ""I'm not sure I feel like being inside a snow globe, but with the panels the way they are, I do feel like I am inside a giant diamond, which definitely does feel luxurious."" Along with the rooftop, the J. Parker is also premiering a new winter menu of small plates and bites by Chef Paul Virant (whose name sake restaurant, Perennial Virant, rests on the ground floor of the hotel) that includes things like hand cut fries, beef shank chili, and shrimp sliders.  Though the food is tempting, Brandy was truly smitten by the cocktails, created by seasoned bar vet Allie Kim.  The craft concoctions include a few warm unique cocktails, like the Rockin' Chair, a sort of spiced apple cider with rum and topped by a pad of melting butter, but Brandy's favorite was the Smoke Rings, a combination of boubon, white chocolate, root beer, and a whole egg that sounds like a sweet mess, but actually tastes sophisticated and surprisingly, well, smokey.

Del Seoul,https://www.zomato.com/chicago/del-seoul-lincoln-park/reviews,"Aug 17, 2017",1,"Synopsis: [1] Ordered over $60 worth of food.  They messed up our order (admitted fault) and demanded we pay the $2 difference (lol seriously?  It's $2) to switch out 2 shrimp tacos with what we ordered- 2 fish tacos.  [2] Never even gave us the soontofu ($11) that we ordered until we reminded them (after we were already done eating the rest of the food).  [3] The absolute worst attitude from staff and the manager that we have ever experienced.  This situation may not happen to you but attitudes don't change.  Expect the same service.  See below.    As somebody who worked in food & beverage, it baffles me how some in the industry fail to understand that customer loyalty makes up the brunt of profitability.  You don't make most of your $$ from customers who look up restaurants on yelp- you make it from repeat customers.  We had 2 waiters and the manager insist that ""mistakes happen when it gets busy"" and that we'd be ""surprised how many mistakes are made.""  So customers are supposed to bear the burden...when you make mistakes?    Simple question: If we'd actually ordered the cheaper tacos instead of the more $$ tacos, would you have given us a store credit of $2 (lol)?  Exactly.  In addition, we never even got the soontofu that we paid for.  When the owner came out with it (after we informed him of this second issue, and as we were leaving), he glared at us.  Overall, their attitude was absolutely dreadful.  One of the waiters stuck the tacos under our faces and simply said ""so do you want these or not?  If not, then pay the difference.""  The manager came over ""to make sure everything was okay"" but yet never offered to actually just give us the tacos we ordered.  Why even bother coming over?  Their attitude was so bad that we ended up throwing the soontofu that the manager gave us (to-go) away because we were afraid they might've spit in it...even though we paid for it.      Look- at the end of the day, this post may not dissuade anybody from coming here...but I'll tell you what- you've certainly lost our business.  The 4 of us have been coming here for the past 8 years since our freshman year of college...and considering that it's one of our go-to spots and we're in Chicago permanently, that's a lot of 0's in lost profit over $2.

Not only is the service horrible and makes you feel unwelcome, but the food is overpriced and bland. Last week when me and my fiancé went in into this place, we had high hopes. There was pretty much great reviews here on yelp and we know that the reviews on this site usually do not let us down. This was the exception. We walked in and grabbed a menu to see what we wanted. We then figured it out and went up to order. The girl behind the counter seemed so unenthused and when my fiancé told her what she wanted she replied in a very hostile tone. We just chalked it up to having a bad day or something and hoped the food spoke for the place. We then sat down and waited for our food. When it was done a guy delivered it to us. He walked over to us threw it down on the table and slid it to us, it almost fell off the table. We said thank you, trying to be nice, and he did not say a word back or even make eye contact. We then began eating the food. I will say everything had at least an ok flavor. We had a shrimp taco, steak taco, a banh mi sandwich, and the kimchi fries. We started with the tacos and while the flavor was good, it was pretty much all lettuce topping. Hardly any meat filler in either taco. Next we moved to the banh mi sandwich. The steak in it was good, but the bread was pretty horrible and there was no real toppings on it. I was especially excited to try my first banh mi sandwich after seeing all the other good ones on yelp and people telling me about them. I hope this one was not representative of other banh mi sandwiches because then I will not try one again. Lastly we ate the kimchi fries. While they had a good flavor, there was barely any kimchi on it, and the fries were cold. So I would save your money and skip this place and if you want to try a spin on good korean food, or just a place that at least gives mediocre customer service, there are plenty of other places, even on the same street!

We would have only one chance to get this right. Based on Urbanspoon reviews, we chose Bacino's. We made the right choice.   What a fantastic dining experience! We started with the antipasto marinaro, salumi with cheese, bread and black olives marinated in olive oil. THe wife had a glass or red wine and i had a local beer- of which i cant remember the name- we sampled six locally made beers, each a work of art in itself. For the pizza, we decided on the most recommended pizza on Urbanspoon, the Bacino's Special deep dish. We finished the meal with gelato and a piece of tiramisu.   Now that I've told you what we had, I'll describe them. THe beers were superb. The beer list is extensive and stocked with what ever your preference is- from locally made craft beers to all american types to a variety of imports. Can't go wrong with the beer. For the food, wow- fresh is the best way to describe it. I dpn't think i've ever used that word for pizza before- but every ingredient was fresh. The antipasto was amazing and could have served as a lunch, stand alone.   I don't want this to go on too long, but needless to say, we made the right choice for Chicago pizza. Me and the wife have traveled the country eating and we agree that this Bacino's is on par with our top two dining experiences; Dough in San Antonio and Rendevous in Memphis.

We have been looking for the Chicago style pizza that satisfies since we started making yearly road trips to Chicago from Grand Rapids MI. We made it a day at the Lincoln Park Zoo and decided to just urbanspoon it for pizza in the area. Bacinos is a half mile from the zoo, which made it super convenient since we still aren't too familiar with the downtown area. On to the pizza itself... We ordered a medium with Italian sausage and fresh garlic. This size is perfect for 2 people who want to bring home leftovers and enough for 4 people to go home full. The sauce is very mild, meant to be a platform for all of their fresh ingredients. The garlic complimented the sauce pefectly , making the sauce explode with flavor. The Italian sausage was perfect, not overpowering like some sausage can be. But the mozzarella they use is what hit it out of the park!!! It's silky, creamy, stretchy, gooey, so fantastically fresh that I could have died and went to cheese heaven! The crust is buttery and thick, not like this cardboard stuff we've had at other restaurants, I won't name any big name Chicago pizza places either. It's obviously fresh since they had fresh pizza dough sitting out when we came in. Any pizza lover knows, it starts with the crust, it's gotta be fresh! The staff that was working were friendly and accommodating, that always helps. But they could have been beating us with sticks while we ate our pizza and we'd still come back because this pizza is just that good!!

Range Restaurant,https://www.zomato.com/chicago/range-lincoln-park/reviews,"Apr 03, 2015",4,"Range is a charming neighborhood restaurant in one of my favorite parts of Lincoln Park. The menu is comprised of rustic classics like roast chicken, skirt steak, and burgers. I recently got to attend a sampling of the winter menu and my friends and I were treated to six different selections from the new menu, each paired with a beer. Range’s Chef Luis is very conscious of what his restaurant is serving and his goal is to use locally and responsibly sourced ingredients. It is a farm to table approach that takes advantage of local producers. Range’s menu gives credit to their suppliers by listing their names and location on the menu. Our meal began with a duo of appetizers: Meatballs and Buffalo Cauliflower. The hearty meatballs were drown in a cherry-heirloom sauce and had a duck egg in the center. Meatballs as an appetizer are a bit of a trend these days in Chicago, I like meatballs, but think they are a little heavy for an appetizer. The meatballs were good, but the buffalo cauliflower was a showstopper. Cauliflower was covered in buffalo sauce and served with buttermilk blue cheese sauce. This was the dish that everyone wanted to learn how to recreate at home. Next we had a Russian Kale Salad. I really don’t like kale, but I ate every bite of this salad, and it was huge. I think everyone ate every bite of their salad. Apparently if you add apples, dried cranberries, Mona cheese, croutons, and a buttermilk dressing to kale, it turns into the best thing ever. Want a healthy dinner? Just get the buffalo cauliflower and a salad. Then we moved onto the entrees. We got to sample both the Skirt Steak and the Chicken. The skirt steak came with a side of shiitake ravioli and spinach and was drizzled with a stout sauce. The shiitake ravioli was made with fresh pasta and was loaded with meaty mushrooms. The chicken was rubbed with smoked pepper, and served with pickled veggies, roasted garlic, fingerling potatoes, and a horseradish root biscuit gravy. The chicken was another dish that got everyone talking. It was really fresh – to the point where it had much for flavor than the chicken I usually eat. Dessert was a Chocolate Cake with Graham Cracker Ice Cream and Marshmallow. This was a really fun way of making s’mores more sophisticated. The Graham Cracker Ice Cream was a surprising treat, and the toasted marshmallow on the top was freshly made and completed the s’mores theme. A few weeks later I returned to Range for brunch with over a dozen of my girl friends. There is a great back room, with its own fireplace that is perfect for events. I ordered the Ham Benedict, because I am obsessed with benedicts. The theme of the brunch was organizing and setting goals for the new year, and we were all given to do lists from Thyme Is Honey which help you set goals for the day, menu plan, and make sure you drink enough water. Range’s brunch has a nice mix of breakfast dishes and heartier (man friendly) lunch fare, making it a fun place for a group brunch with friends, or a quiet brunch with your significant other. Range is located at 1119 West Webster Street in Lincoln Park. They do take reservations and they are very accommodating to large groups.

When the menu for such a place reveals only three dishes normally associated with the British Isles, that should be another.  A bouncer at the door should be a third.  Unfortunate for us that we were in a rush and didn't have time to find another restaurant. And I didn't feel like the burger she raved about, nor the 'build-your-own' macaroni and cheese. In an Irish pub, I want food appropriate to the site, so I got fish & chips.   The exterior of the fish was a cross between batter and breading and was just on the edge of being burnt. The fries were lackluster and the accompanying frozen peas added nothing to the experience.  My wife had a goat cheese salad (without the goat cheese), that included moist slices of grilled chicken breast, pears, raspberries, walnuts with a vinaigrette. This was actually quite good.

Noodles In The Pot,https://www.zomato.com/chicago/noodles-in-the-pot-lincoln-park/reviews,"Apr 05, 2012",4.5,"Excellent flavor in the sauces and dips!. My sister raved about this place, saying she's dreamed about eating the food! Of course, we had to go there for dinner when we came for a visit!  We started with appetizers of Spring Rolls and Crab Rangoon to share. The Spring Rolls were excellent, but it was a bit strange to have them cold with warm sauce. However, the tamarind sauce was fantastic, so it made it worth it. The only thing I would modify is that there were a bit too many sprouts. The flavor of the Crab Rangoon was good, but I still prefer my hometown Chinese restaurant's version a bit better. I appreciated the amount of crab meat in them, but I was not a fan of the added chicken. However, the sweet & sour sauce was so wonderful. Luckily my mom was smart enough to save it, as it helped to add flavor to her meal later. Overall, I would recommend both appetizers, but if you have to pick one, go with the Spring Rolls.  For my entree, I went with one of my sister's recommendations, the Pad See Ew, substituting the thin rice noodles for the wide ones. I cannot say anything bad about the dish. It used the same sweet & sour sauce that was given with the crab rangoon, which was a-ok with me. 100% recommendation on this.  My sister had the dish of her dreams, the Chicken Coconut Curry. I personally hate the taste of curry, so for me, this dish was doomed, but I did try it, and either the curry flavor was very mild or the coconut softened it up enough (or both), and I didn't completely hate it. If you like curry, I would definitely go for it as my sister doesn't dream about food very often. It also came with cucumber salad, which had a very light, but yummy marinade.   My mom was not very hungry, so she decided just to get a side of Steamed Vegetables. There was no sauce added, so they were a little bland to me, and I didn't like the mushrooms at all, but my mom added her saved sweet & sour sauce and that helped a lot.   I tried the Gingerale for drink, and it was very light and tasty, but not quite as satisfying as your standard gingerale.

We will definitely not be back and we do not recommend this place at all”   I get the feeling that your experience at Macku (with our first server at least Tall, big build, Asian) can depend MASSIVELY on who you are and possibly even on how you look. My boyfriend and I went to celebrate our 7th anniversary last Saturday. We both work and go to school full time so date nights are rare and we had been looking forward to this all month. We had a reservation so we were sat quickly and noticed a few empty tables so we were looking forward to it being a smooth dinner. Our initial server, whose name I wish I would have caught must of thought we were deaf - He came to our table and loudly asked “What do you want to drink?” - No introduction, no chef specials, just those 6 words.  We totally disregarded it, we were there to celebrate you know? I simply said “no not yet, we’d like to take a look at the menu first, thank you.” He grunted as he walked away and came back within a few minutes and loudly asked again “WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DRINK”, I told him we were ready to order some appetizers if he didn’t mind. Which of course he did, and he made sure to make it known, he said he wasn’t ready for an order and that he would be right back and walked away. He then left to take care of the table right next to us, in a gentle and very informative manner he explained the menu and took their order without any hesitation!!!   Before becoming a nurse I’ve waited tables at many restaurants, because of that, I am always apt to cut servers a lot of slack but this guy was so rude and his treatment was simply inexcusable. I honestly don’t even know how or why we made it this far at this point. Anyhow as we were trying to order off the menu he would simply say NO, NO, NO WE DON’T HAVE THAT - Instead of suggesting what they did actually have because at this point it seemed as if they had nothing. We were able to order a few appetizers, sashimi, and our drinks. We received our food rather quickly, my boyfriend (FYI: HE IS A SUSHI CHEF downtown) asked for Wasabi and the server SCOLDED him and said he would ruin the sashimi with more wasabi  and refused to bring it to the table. We asked a different server for the wasabi, and with no hesitation it was brought to us. Again, why are we still here? This is beyond ridiculous, it can’t possibly get any worse, can it?  Ohhhh but it certainly can. After repeatedly seeing that same server kindly explain the menu to other tables, he came to our table and said “The chef’s have a big order coming so you have to order your entire meal right now if not you’re going to have to wait more than an hour for food so what do you want” 1. We were the ONLY table he said that too. 2. There were a few empty tables still and 3. We still hadn’t received the drinks we ordered more than 15 minutes prior and yet he was trying to kick us out?!   After botching every possible aspect of our meal, I voiced my opinion to the manager. She sincerely apologized and offered us a Do Over with a different server. Nickolas was our second server and the experience difference was insane, he was fantastic and explained everything to us which we are grateful for - However, Terrible service can overpower any food, no matter how carefully prepared and delicious it may be.

See below.    As somebody who worked in food & beverage, it baffles me how some in the industry fail to understand that customer loyalty makes up the brunt of profitability.  You don't make most of your $$ from customers who look up restaurants on yelp- you make it from repeat customers.  We had 2 waiters and the manager insist that ""mistakes happen when it gets busy"" and that we'd be ""surprised how many mistakes are made.""  So customers are supposed to bear the burden...when you make mistakes?    Simple question: If we'd actually ordered the cheaper tacos instead of the more $$ tacos, would you have given us a store credit of $2 (lol)?  Exactly.  In addition, we never even got the soontofu that we paid for.  When the owner came out with it (after we informed him of this second issue, and as we were leaving), he glared at us.  Overall, their attitude was absolutely dreadful.  One of the waiters stuck the tacos under our faces and simply said ""so do you want these or not?  If not, then pay the difference.""  The manager came over ""to make sure everything was okay"" but yet never offered to actually just give us the tacos we ordered.  Why even bother coming over?  Their attitude was so bad that we ended up throwing the soontofu that the manager gave us (to-go) away because we were afraid they might've spit in it...even though we paid for it.      Look- at the end of the day, this post may not dissuade anybody from coming here...but I'll tell you what- you've certainly lost our business.  The 4 of us have been coming here for the past 8 years since our freshman year of college...and considering that it's one of our go-to spots and we're in Chicago permanently, that's a lot of 0's in lost profit over $2.  We never asked for FREE FOOD OR EXTRA ANYTHING...just simply what we ordered.",Jack Chen,45046144,31410630,DINING

Not only is the service horrible and makes you feel unwelcome, but the food is overpriced and bland. Last week when me and my fiancé went in into this place, we had high hopes. There was pretty much great reviews here on yelp and we know that the reviews on this site usually do not let us down. This was the exception. We walked in and grabbed a menu to see what we wanted. We then figured it out and went up to order. The girl behind the counter seemed so unenthused and when my fiancé told her what she wanted she replied in a very hostile tone. We just chalked it up to having a bad day or something and hoped the food spoke for the place. We then sat down and waited for our food. When it was done a guy delivered it to us. He walked over to us threw it down on the table and slid it to us, it almost fell off the table. We said thank you, trying to be nice, and he did not say a word back or even make eye contact. We then began eating the food. I will say everything had at least an ok flavor. We had a shrimp taco, steak taco, a banh mi sandwich, and the kimchi fries. We started with the tacos and while the flavor was good, it was pretty much all lettuce topping. Hardly any meat filler in either taco. Next we moved to the banh mi sandwich. The steak in it was good, but the bread was pretty horrible and there was no real toppings on it. I was especially excited to try my first banh mi sandwich after seeing all the other good ones on yelp and people telling me about them. I hope this one was not representative of other banh mi sandwiches because then I will not try one again. Lastly we ate the kimchi fries. While they had a good flavor, there was barely any kimchi on it, and the fries were cold. So I would save your money and skip this place and if you want to try a spin on good korean food, or just a place that at least gives mediocre customer service, there are plenty of other places, even on the same street!

Avli Taverna,https://www.zomato.com/chicago/alinea-lincoln-park/reviews,"Jul 03, 2017",4,"I think it's best to not read reviews, articles or watch any documentaries on Alinea or Chef Grant Achatz if you plan on attending this place. I knew enough but didn't want to research anymore because a place like this with all the accolades can set up really high expectations. - Michelin Guide - 3 Stars - #15 in the World's 50 Best Restaurants - 2016 - Outstanding Restaurant in The United States, James Beard Foundation - 2016 This place is unique for sure and focuses on presentation and ""the show"" as it tries to confuse your senses and give you an experience.  They typically release bookings on the 15th of the month, two months in advance. Bookings are released at 11 AM Central Time. For our early June trip, my husband tried for a while to get reservations and ended up booking about 2 months ahead in The Salon @ Alinea. It's like buying a concert ticket for this place - you prepay for the experience and hope to god that you're feeling well and can make the trip there (if you're not from Chicago). There are 10-14 courses and the price is anywhere from $175-$255 per person. price includes food, service charge and taxes. In our very expensive Canadian $ conversion, that came to $640 CAD for two people. When you order a bottle of wine the night that you are dining, that is extra which of course is then another few hundred. So for Canadians if you order wine, expect that your total experience could be $400-$500 per person. Yes it is pricey. If you cancel ahead of time, your tickets are transferable to another visit but it's making the reservation that's the tough part.  The dining room is quite surprisingly formal compared to the service and food. The servers are friendly and quite anal with service. While placing chopsticks for one course onto the chopstick rest, one stick fell off onto the table (not the floor) and the server took the set of chopsticks away and replaced the entire thing. LOL quite the overkill. Anyways, we enjoyed the sommelier, she was very knowledgeable and provided options that had a wide price range and didn't just push certain items.  The meal lasted just over 2 hours with 10 courses so each course was roughly $32 CAD excluding the wine. Some items were better than others but overall I did enjoy my experience and it is something (if you are able to do) should try. The helium balloon was extremely fun, nostalgic and magical. We were to view the kitchen when we were leaving and man there are a ton of staff who work there and of course the serving staff. It's quite the operation that made for a fun and unique experience.",DineoutGal,21097270,30909465,DINING

First, the wait staff was excellent from start to finish. They make sure that guest have means of transport because it is likely you are not street legal if you order the wine pairing. They were courteous and a lot fun, very informed about every dish, and wine we were drinking. The experience could have been intimidating in an upscale restaurant but the staff deflated that instantly and I no point did I feel we were treated equally to all other guests regardless of class, race, or status.  Second, the food and wine (Standard) was all phenomenal. My least favorite was I believe the beef tongue/cheek dish but it paired wonderfully with the wine. The best dish for me had to be Yellow. A yellow banana curry dish with saffron and fried pork belly paired with sake (Rice beer/wine). The tomato custard, scallop noodle soup, and Fry dish have honorable mentions. All the paired wines were excellent, most were french imports and well worth the price.  The value of the meal is well worth it. The wine pairing alone comes to about $10/glass.

The building is unmarked and the doorman ushers you into a long, narrowing, almost pitch black hall and automatic doors open at the end and they take your coats and seat you. We were first to arrive in our section and we had three servers. I chose not to do the wine pairing as I'd read that it's a bit much. They told me they don't really have a wine list but they'd discus my preferences and choose for me accordingly - OK! Started off with a glass of champagne and some caviar with foam that actually tasted like a buttery brioche! Strangest thing - it was like something out of Charlie and the Chocolate. Second course they brought out a basket and woven into it, there were two edible roots and we had to feel for them and find them as they looked the same as the twigs the basket was made of. There were too many courses to list but one of them involved an actual 'camp fire' that they brought to the table with raw fish on pine twigs for you to roast. They then left the fire burning for ten minutes or so and when you thought they were coming to take it away - they pulled out a piece of pork belly wrapped in seaweed and a parsnip that looked exactly like the other logs! There was a shaved ice palate cleanser that was infused with the essence of chocolate - again, something so strange and almost unnerving - a clear ice that tasted exactly like creamy chocolate.  Instructions were so specific ""Hold this with your non dominant hand"" etc. If you left your seat, they instantly pull out your chair for you and replace your napkin with a brand new folded one. I've never experienced service like it. They anticipated everything and it was almost more of a choreographed dance. One dish was served on a broken piece of concrete with truffle meringue that looked like more concrete and the server ""tagged"" it with a can of spray paint that was actually a balsamic reduction. The edible helium balloon was super fun! Same sort of texture as cotton candy but actually tasted like green apple. Not the gross synthetic ""green apple"" flavour you're used to though. Finally, and unexpectedly, Chef Achatz came out and painted all of the elements of our desert on the table and my husband asked him if he'd be offended if we took a few photos. He's incredibly gracious and we felt so honoured to be in the presence of such a genius. The desert was out of this world - caramelized banana, frozen coconut, passionfruit, pineapple - he'd taken all of the the flavours and condensed and enhanced them, completely reimagined the textures and then formed them back to looking somewhat like the original ingredient.   Before we left, we were given the opportunity to watch the kitchen for a few minutes and it was so incredibly organized. Dozens of people in white preparing things while people in black barked weird codes and instructions - they were like the coxswains of the kitchen.

When we made our reservation for Alinea, the web site stated that it was an 18- 22 course menu. When we arrived at the restaurant on May 20th they said they were serving 15 courses this evening. No big deal. After all, we leave most of these restaurants totally overstuffed and begging for mercy. Not so with Alinea. The portions were as small as I have ever seen. Most of the courses were literally one or two bites. Also, every other tasting restaurant that we have gone to serves an Amuse Bouche and a tower of cookies and chocolates to end the meal. Some even give you a small pound loaf to go home with. Not Alinea. This was the first time ever that we have walked out of a restaurant hungry. Now mind you that a restaurant that has more chefs than customers, and enough equipment in the kitchen for a science lab, does put out very good tasting high quality food.                                                       A friend of the family also made reservations there for an Early July date. When she made the reservations the website still said the same 18-22 courses. However, sometime after booking the reservation, she noticed that the ticket portal had a new message of 12- 14 courses. As of July 9th, the main web page still says 18-22 courses. Not fair Alinea. You need to serve the number of courses that people sign up for or make courses of more substance.               They serve no bread which would have been nice to mop up the sauces. The website fails to mention that they do not serve liquor. Beer and wine only. We were disappointed in this. We did order a bottle of champagne for about $145. It was very good.          In addition, this is the first restaurant we have ever eaten in that requires paying in advance, including a %20 gratuity. This means that you are laying out $600+ well in advance of the meal. If you need to cancel for some reason, you are stuck trying to sell the tickets in their portal. Good luck if you get sick the day before.            After paying $800 for 2 people we were tremendously disappointed. Quite frankly, we do not understand what all the fuss is. Until the Emperor realizes he is not wearing any clothes, we would highly recommend searching out other choices for a unique high end food experience.

When we discovered that we would be going to Chicago for a convention, I immediately began scoping out area restaurants to try. One of my friends has a client who is part owner of Alinea, so he suggested we make a pilgimage, and we eagerly agreed.  This is not a standard dining experience, rather it's a unique barrage of flavors, fragrances and textures designed to impart a very special culinary experience. And it truly delivers on that premise.  We had the wine pairings to go with the experience which really added to it, despite the fact I'm not a big fan of white wines in general. These were all very good and provided a boost to each course.  I am not going to go course by course, as it seems some of these are repeated and I wouldn't want to spoil the experience, but essentially 20 odd courses are brought out in timely fashion, each accompanied by a description from the attentive wait staff and every one is interesting, flavorful and thought provoking. The ingredients are diverse and in some cases unique.  The courses are universally small, but over time you discover that you are sated in a most pleasing way.  When you leave, you realize that it was truly a unique dining experience.  I'd add the following critiques / semi negative points:  1.) Yes, it's expensive. (Totally worth it as an experience) 2.) No cocktails (I love a cocktail to start off a meal - it just seems too bad that you are compelled to go with wine as a beverage - though the wine pairing was extremely well done) 3.) The wait staff was a bit overly familiar and one waiter made a sort of odd comment to my wife which I found disrespectful. I believe he meant it as humor, but he failed badly.

Avli Taverna,https://www.zomato.com/chicago/alinea-lincoln-park/reviews,"Jun 01, 2012",4.5,"My first 3 Michelin star experience. When you walk in to Alinea you find yourself in this corridor that is straight out of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Once you figure out how to get in you have three or four friendly faces all ready to take care of you. It seems as though they could see you through the door. We were promptly brought to our table upstairs which I didn't find particularly comfortable. It was a little stuffy and sterile but I respect the modern aesthetic. Before I knew it, we were served the first course of Steelhead roe, curry, and coconut. This first dish was very bright and a great way to start the experience. We decided to go with the wine pairing as well which started with a champagne cocktail. Course after course came out of which three or four really stood out. The fourth course blew us away. Dashi broth was made at our table in a Japanese siphon coffee maker. Moments later a plate was laid before us with what looked exactly like tofu accompanied with daikon and carrot. Then the dashi was poured over the ""tofu"". Except the tofu wasn't tofu at all, but a scallop mousse that was fried. Not only did this morsel look like tofu, it had a consistency that was nearly identical to soft tofu. It was the first time during the meal that I started to understand what all the hype was about. The next dish to garner my attention was the ""lamb........?????....!!!!"". I've never been an enormous fan of lamb but that's because I didn't know it could be like this! The lamb came out perfectly cooked three ways; osso bucco, belly, and loin. It came with a wonderful jus or reduction of some kind which could have easily finished the dish. At Alinea they took what was a beautifully executed dish and ramped it up with a few condiments. Well... 60 condiments to be precise. They must have added a few since we visited, as they now call it Lamb 86. That dish was a lot of fun and tasted phenomenal. Immediately following our Lamb we were presented with a small dish called Truffle Explosion, which was exactly what it sounds like. Is there anywhere else in the world that has a truffle course? This little pouch punches you in the face with the most decadent umami flavor... I'm having a hard time coming up with the words to describe it... it's that good. Anyone that's familiar with Alinea and Grant Achatz is probably aware of the elaborate desserts they prepare. The final course certainly did not disappoint in that aspect. Painted table... cotton candy... liquid nitrogen. I'll let the rest be a surprise. There were, however, a few things about our four hour dinner I was not super excited about. The Wooly Pig comprised of ham and squid was good, but not great. It had nice texture but lacked a little in flavor. One of the last courses was a helium balloon of green apple. It was really sticky. A woman sitting next to us got it in her hair, which I'm sure she had a hard time getting out. It was fine, I suppose, if you like sour apple. In the chef's defense I would not say I love sour apple. That being said, I think he deserves a lot of props for figuring it out. It must have taken a lot of trial and error to perfect something like that, not to mention that it is the most whimsical thing I've ever eaten. I am really happy to have had the experience at Alinea but would not spend the money to do it again. I know Alinea is a molecular gastronomy restaurant but I wish they would lean just a little more towards perfecting the flavor and just a little less on the tricks. I love molecular gastronomy when done correctly, but I left that night deciding my next fine dining experience will be more on the rustic side. After we got home and looked up some of the wines, I realized just how expensive the wine pairing was. I intended to write that it was overpriced. However, I have never had wine paired with a meal so well, so that would not have been fair. I certainly don't regret it. After all, you are not just paying for the wine but for the knowledge the sommelier brings to the table and his ability to heighten your experience. That aspect of our evening was truly astounding. The biggest piece of advice I can offer if you're planning on dining at Alinea, is do not look up a bunch of videos and pictures of the courses you could possibly be served. This is one thing I truly regret. Being surprised from course to course would have been a lot more fun and enjoyable experience. I'm sure a restaurant like this changes their menu often, so hopefully I didn't ruin too much of it for you.

They over charge you.  So, dinner lasted just about 3 hours. We were exhausted at the end. Out of the roughly 15 courses, there were only 2 there were utter duds. One involved rhubarb and onion. Blech. The other was some kind of yogurt ball thing. Bland.  The service was too automated and robotic seeming. We heard the wait staff have the same conversations with people at other tables. Plus, they were too intrusive and my wife and I had little time to talk, as we were always being interrupted.  We have gotten the cookbook and many of the recipes that were at the restaurant are in it. The book's at least a year old, so it seems that they don't change the menu much.  Some of the courses were kind of pointless, like a kind of candied bacon that was just ok.  Some of the courses were really excellent, like this one with lobster with a butter blanket. And a sweet and savory gelatin thing served in a glass tube that you have to ""inhale"" to eat.  The courses are all small, as expected, but there are so many of them that you don't really leave hungry.

If I’m going to shell out $10.25 for toast and avocado, it better be the best damn version I’ve ever had.  And, oh Le Pain Quotidien, how you delivered.   I got the aptly named “Avocado Toast” dish. The seedy bread was crunchy and had just the right amount of give to keep it from crumbling like a Nature Valley Bar. The avocado was cool and creamy, pools of olive oil gathering among its green mounds. Chia seeds were sprinkled on top to keep the dish as hipster vegan as possible. A little mound of kale was heaped on the side of the plate (what's a vegan to do without her kale at every meal?!). Unnecessary? Maybe. But I can’t complain when my mouth is full of avocado and toast. I was at a work meeting, so I had to keep my “yuuummms” to a minimum.   My dining companions had the same dish, so I can’t remark on any of the other offerings. There are a lot of vegan options available, which can be impossible to find at similar joints. Green tea was good, although I wished they served honey with those cool wooden stirring spoons. But now I’m just being picky.

You've possibly heard that Germans miss the break when they live in exile. It's close to impossible to get certain types of brea in other countries, because bakeries in Germany are local businesses that have existed for hundreds of years. The trade of a baker is highly respected and requires are four-year apprenticeship. Bakers get up in the very early hours of the morning to bake the bread for their communities. Then there is sour dough. It is made from a culture of bacteria and yeasts, and the process itself and can result in various defects in the bread. A small amount is always retained to start the next batch. Bread types are regulated by law in Europe. To cut a long story short: you can taste the difference. Americans have come a long way from the days where the measure of good bread was how easily you could compress it when testing the bag in the supermarket. Americans appear to be ready for the real thing. This outfit has the goods. You will not find this anywhere else. Try their sourdough rye. Prices are not even exorbitant.

I just got home from Goose Island Clybourn, and I have to say that this is only the second time I have been so bothered by a bar or restaurant that I have felt the need to warn others not to go there. Based on other reviews I have read, it seems that there might be one waitress, in particular, who works there and has given others the same unacceptable service. (I really hope for Goose Island's sake that there aren't multiple waitresses there with the same bad-for-business service problems.) When our waitress took our orders, she wasn't particularly friendly, but I figured that maybe she was the type of person who is very focused on making sure to get everyone's order down quickly. Unfortunately, after she took my order, she swiftly turned and walked away before my friend could ask if he could tweak his order. I was then told by the table that before I got there, she didn't seem particularly interested in attending to our table, which the others found confusing, since we were a large group.  When we got our food, most of us agreed that it was pretty good. I bought the veggie burger item with sweet potato fries, and I was pleased enough with my own food. I felt that the price was a bit steep for the quantity and quality, though. I did not order any beer, since I'm not a beer guy, but the rest of the people at the table seemed to enjoy theirs quite a bit. She did come come check on us once when we were eating, but she did not ask about the food. When she talked to us, she made almost no eye contact, spoke very softly, and seemed irritated and disinterested. I assumed she was going to check with both halves of the table, since she turned away from my side when she asked if anyone needed more to drink. I had to grab her attention as she took off so that I could make sure that I'd have something to drink with the other half of my meal. She came back to check on us again around an hour or so after we had ordered our food, and one of my friends asked if there were any ""birthday desserts"" because we were there celebrating a friend's birthday. The waitress grumbled that they do have one, but that the kitchen was closed, seeming irritated that we didn't know that. (We did not see this advertised on the menu, and the door merely said what time the place opens every day.) She then left in one of her now-signature huffs.  We paid the bill and were later told (around 11:10 PM) that they were closed. The man who told us wasn't particularly friendly about it, but he was nowhere near as unfriendly as the waitress. While one of my friends and i were waiting to use the bathroom, we checked online to see if we could find a closing time for Goose Island. I saw closing times of 10 PM, midnight, and 1 AM listed for Wednesday nights. It does seem convenient that there is no closing time listed on the door, making it easier to decide to close whenever the employees want to get rid of customers. On the other hand, if their closing time really was 10 PM, someone could have told us and we would have promptly wrapped everything up and left. As someone who used to work at the Borders bookstores, I know what it's like to be at work late and be irritated by customers who won't leave. I feel bad if those workers felt like they were stuck at work for an unusual amount of time because of us, but I don't feel *too* bad because they could have politely let us know of their closing time and did not.  In summary, the beer was enjoyed, the food arrived in a timely manner and was good (but a bit pricey), and the only way the waitress could have been worse is if she had messed up our orders or fought with us. Perhaps there are other waiters and waitresses who are great there, but the one we had tonight definitely belongs on the list of the top 5 worst waiters/waitresses I have ever dealt with in my life. (I don't remember her name, but she had curly brown hair.) Like I said, I have worked a service job before, and I know how hard it can be to work a long closing shift. Sometimes, you have a really bad day and it's hard to go in and do your job. Unfortunately, you still have to work hard and be pleasant. I don't think she could have asked for a nicer large group tonight, yet she treated us like we had all ruined her day by coming into Goose Island Clybourn. If she is like this with any kind of frequency, then she must be seriously hurting their business. I know I can't see myself returning any time in the near future.",Garrett,22896521,16097419,DINING

Sushi and then onto a ""surprise event."" The surprise event ended up being a Sunday evening showing of Hellcab. Hellcab is a play, which runs during the holiday season at the Profiles Theatre up on the northside and is fantastic (highly recommend). Mad points to my boyfriend for finding out about this gem of a show and surprising me with tickets. My boyfriend is always weary of Asian restaurants that offer a large menu and more specifically those that cross over different Asian cuisines. Shine advertises themselves as ""Asian Cuisine & Sushi Bar"" and the menu includes sushi, thai, stir-fry, and house specialities which range from Chinese to Japanese dishes.  I, on the other hand, enjoy these restaurants when the different cuisines are done with quality as I can get a few of my favorite things (e.g. crab rangoon, maki, and pad see ew). We started with a few rolls - spicy tuna maki (right), one of the specials (included shrimp tempura and was served warm - middle), and the shine maki (right). We enjoyed all three rolls, my favorite being the special and my boyfriend preferring the shine maki.  Not the best sushi we have ever had but certainly not the worst (here's looking at your Zoku Sushi - thanks for the food poisoning).

I stopped in on a recent Thursday afternoon around lunchtime to find only one other table in the place occupied. I was quickly seated and ordered the “Porker McGee” and Sriracha & Bacon Deviled Eggs, after a hearty endorsement from the bartender.  The “pit-smoked pulled pork” was neither pit smoked nor pulled, just a roughly-chopped, pre-packaged pork product warmed on a flattop grill. The “Carolina-style” sauce was certainly not North or South Carolina-style – instead, the pork was simply soaked in Cattleman’s BBQ Sauce, that sickening, super sweet, tomato-based restaurant topping banned in most Third World nations - and certainly never seen in any decent BBQ joint. Even worse, the semi-stale bun was buttered and toasted.  Alas, to further ruin the $11.00 sandwich, the meat was topped with a sopping wet pile of bagged cabbage/carrot coleslaw and two slices of cucumber. Yes, I said cucumber.  Folks, a true Southerner might put a slice or two of bread-n-butter pickles on an Eastern North Carolina-style pork sandwich, but NEVER a sliver of plain cucumber. They shutter and burn restaurants in the South for showing less respect to 'cue.  The deviled eggs were nicely prepared, with a notable burn-the-lips heat from the Sriracha Sauce. But at $6.00 for two medium-sized eggs, the portion left me hanging and wanting more. (Another tip - order a side of salad dressing, 'cause the eggs are delivered on a plate that features enough foliage to act as an appetizer of its own).  The tater tots were rocket hot and perfectly fried, but not enough to save the rest of the meal.",Just Jamie,21394720,16104238,DINING

When I informed her that requiring a minimum purchase was a violation of the merchant agreement they needed to sign to accept cards at all, she flippantly brushed it off.
