Unfortunately, it did NOT live up to the hype. The dimsum was “okay” - fine but far from wow - and the service was lacking overall. The restaurant itself was tired and dingy. Go elsewhere."

Won ton soup was also hot and the pork was tasty. Liked the coating on the shrimp in the walnut shrimp. Shredded pork with udon noodles was good. The place is large and we were seated in an ample booth. The menu had many offerings we would have liked to try.

Comes out nice and fresh. I like the concept that the food is made to order and not sitting on a cart. Ordered several items on the dim sum menu as well as the lunch menu. The ribs could be better but they were still decent. Everything else was great

Our wait was only 15 minutes for a table. This location of MingHim did not have outdoor seating. The waiter was very helplful with our order, so we did not have to use the pad to place our order. For the two of us, we ordered 4 dim sum dishes and one order of steamed vegetables and enjoyed all of the food. We probably should have ordered one more dim sum. Food came quickly and was very hot. The wine was not of great quality. Compared to the NYC area, this was a $$ place, not $$$. It was nice that the majority of diners were Asian. We would return to MingHin on our next trip to Chicago."

I know, odd pairing right??? We have traveled and sampled Oriental Food far and wide on every opportunity that we can. Our latest adventure was into the famed China Town District of Chicago. The area came highly touted and didn't disappoint. Our recent trip was a little over two hours from our homes in Wisconsin to MingHin Cuisine on Archer Avenue, in Chicago. We read dozens of positive reviews before coming and were prepared to expect excellence! We started with a lovely cucumber salad, potstickers and seafood hot and sour soup. WOW!!! The cucumber salad was amazing and the flavors of the dressing was steeped in garlic and wonderfully flavored oil. The potstickers were perfectly formed and steamed, stuffed with a savory sausage. The sauces were amazing! The sea food hot and sour soup was the finest. The broth was rich in flavor, but as we explored each ingredient in the soup the flavors burst forward onto the pallet! The taste was extraordinary by any standards.Our entrees included crispy fish, onions and green peppers in a red sweet and spicy sauce - not unlike sweet and sour. This was delicious. We also ordered a combination fried rice, with beef, chicken and pork, as well as an order of shrimp with garlic lobster sauce. Both of these dishes we were able to add vegetables or our choice - a very nice option for those who love to enhance their favorite dishes with specific veggies! We truly appreciate that flexibility of a chef and kitchen with their recipes! All in all, this was the finest of dining experiences and we will return with guests as soon as our schedule allows. Bravo, MingHin Cuisine!!!"

Our friend had made a dinner reservation at MingHin, having read about it. We had an average experience.The food was a mixed bag. The menu featured a very wide range of choices, most of which were familiar Chinese-American classics. Portion sizes were very large and easy to share. Flavors were okay, but unremarkable; it was not better than most other Chinese places we have tried. A couple of items were disappointing, especially the egg rolls, which were greasy and soft rather than crunchy.The establishment had a factor-like atmosphere. It's a huge establishment with lots of tables on two levels. Large trays of food were constantly whizzing by. Staff took orders on tablets. Service was entirely functional, rather than personal--basically, ""what do you want so I can type it into my iPad,"" without any follow-up visits as to how everything tasted, etc. It got the job done, but you can get equally good food and a better atmosphere and service at other establishments.I would not refuse to return, but would also look elsewhere on my next visit to the area."

I was with a group of ten. My wife and I wanted a separate check. We were warned they could only reduce it to 3 separate checks for the group. When the bill came, it seemed to include everyone. We thought that terribly inconvenient, because some wanted to pay by credit, debit, or cash. First Connie's said we could figure it ourselves and leave our estimated amount. My wife, once a waitress herself, complained bitterly. They then said they would break it down for each. It took them at least 30 minutes! What could have been a pleasant evening became very frustrating for everyone. Any inconvenience to the staff of writing separate checks was passed to the customer. As a large group we never had this problem in the past, but not last night.. High points for food, poor points for service. Beware if you are a large group."

On this particular night, we were also one of the last customers to be served. There was a very large table next to us with kids running around. The service was fine, but I think our waiter was a little preoccupied with closing down and cleanup--fair enough.When my husband arrived to join us the next day, we again ate at this restaurant. This time, we were seated outside, as it was earlier in the evening. Our service was good and the food was good. Our son couldn't contain his delight at all of the choices of bubble tea on the menu. When our bill arrived, my husband pointed out that a service charge had been added onto the bill. I had not noticed this the previous night because we paid quickly so that they could close the registers.I am definitely not opposed to a service charge being added onto the bill, but if people don't notice (like me) and then add a tip onto the entire amount, it ends up being quite a lot. You decide if you want to tip more."

The Joy Yee Plus at 2159 S China Place has the bubble teas, ice cream and hot pots. The other one is Joy Yee Noodle at 2139 S China Place with the noodles and smoothies.We enjoy the Shabu Shabu (Japanese Hot Pot) at Joy Yee Plus. The prices are reasonable and quality of food is good. Servers are real attentive. Of course when we order the hot pot, we did not save room for dessert and had to come back several times to try their desserts. The bubble waffle ice cream or Hong Kong style eggettes are delicious. The portion is generous and very filling for one person. The bubble tea is good but the selection is smaller than Joy Yee Noodle. They have some smoothies but the emphasis is on tea at Joy Yee Plus. I did enjoy the Cheese Green Tea."

The soup was served in a humongous bowl and was so delicious! Not greasy at all. The cartilage was so tender you can easily chow down on it! Well seasoned & so light in flavor! We all shared it. They have a long menu list. There was a long list of smoothies made from every fruit you can imagine. It is the most popular item sold. It seems every client that comes in orders it. We had frozen durian & green tea smoothies. Table beside us ordered pho soup, family size. It was served in a huge bowl that it looked like you had a swimming pool bowl of soup in the center of your small table!Every order was served large!We thoroughly enjoyed our lunch specially the bone marrow soup.

You have to go at least once. They have a gigantic pan-Asian menu. They have Japanese, Korean, and mainly Chinese food etc. etc. In addition to that, they have a ginormous smoothie menu. There are so many flavors to choose from, it's just overwhelming! The only issue I have is that, for the smoothies, some of them contain milk, which I'm unfortunately allergic too. I asked them if they can substitute that using soy milk, but they didn't have any. I know a LOT of Asian people who are lactose intolerant as well, so I was surprised that they didn't have soy milk. There was a coffee freeze that I wanted to try, but I couldn't get it because it had milk :("

I went generic and got the chicken pad thai, which was delicious and I had enough leftovers for two more meals. The staff was very friendly and accommodating......and I was with my one year old and two other one year olds and their moms. The best part about this place and why I went back is their smoothies, frozen drinks. My son and I LOVE them. Fresh fruit, ice blended....and you can add pearls or do all sorts of combinations of favors. The menu for these drinks is quite extensive. My favorite is coconut, banana and pineapple. I'm craving it just typing it! And they have a side window if you want to walk up and just order the drinks and not go inside the restaurant. Love this place!"

We felt like having dim sum, so after looking up reviews, we found Triple Crown, which was VERY close to our hotel. We came...on a weekday and were seated right away. We were seated next to the window and had a great view of the community center.  We marked what we wanted on the paper menu and the waiter came and confirmed our order. I think there was maybe one item that was not available that day. In any case, the food was made fresh and delivered to our table when it was ready. I was really impressed with the quality and the freshness. All of the dim sum dishes we ordered were tasty and when the bill was totaled, we were able to see what items we ordered (in English and Chinese) and how much each item cost. I really liked the receipts being so user-friendly. In many Chinese restaurants, everything is hand tallied with Chinese writing and you don't know what anything means (unless you are able to read Chinese). The total bill was surprisingly less than what I had anticipated, so I was very pleased.  I highly recommend this restaurant and will definitely go again the next time I am in Chicago.More"

Beware of pricing.,"The dumplings were just ok. The servers were friendly. BUT… beware of pricing for all things other than the dumplings. The hot tea which is usually served free at most Chinese restaurants is priced at $12.00. That’s for a tiny teapot of very weak jasmine...tea.  And a small plate of side dish kimchi, which again is usually free at other places, is priced at $7.99 for a tiny plate. AND… they DON’T validate parking.

Initially my family was very excited about trying something new as we are from a small town and do not have a restaurant of this type in our...area. We reviewed the menu online and were a little apprehensive about trying something so different but decided that the staff at the restaurant would probably help us through the ordering process. When we arrived at the restaurant, we were led to our table right away and given waters. We were told to scan the QR code to access the menu. We told the waiter that we needed help ordering because we had never been to the restaurant. We asked him to make a recommendation. We aren’t sure if he didn’t speak English or just did not care because he again said that we could check the menu on the QR code but really said nothing further. We ordered an appetizer, the lamb kabobs and 3 orders of dumplings. The picture of the kabobs is very deceiving. A quarter or a ruler should also be included in the picture next to the kabobs to give people the real size of the portion. It was a perfect appetizer for a mouse…not for a hungry family of 4. After we received our food, we asked for silverware because we do not know how to use chopsticks…none were ever delivered. We tried getting the waiters attention several times, but he was no where to be found. We ended up using our fingers and awkwardly stabbing at the dumplings with our chopstick in attempts to skewer them. Our water glasses remained dry as they were never refilled. The final blow was receiving the bill. Over $100 for basically appetizer-sized portions?! Good thing Chi Chinese was right around the corner so we could have an actual meal. Avoid this overpriced place if you are hungry for an actual meal. You will not find it here.More"

They walk you through the ins and outs of hotpot dining. First they bring a pot filled with a scrumptious broth to the table and it bubbles away on the burner. Then you select proteins, greens,...and carbs for your first round - the beef and pork were thinly shaved slices rolled cigar-like. You put your food into the broth and let it cook - over time, the broth becomes more and more interesting as you take out and eat food and add more - mushrooms, bok choy etc. You can add a 2nd and 3rd round of food selections - mussels were excellent, as was the fish.  There was also a counter area offering a large selection of condiments and dipping sauces.   One price for all you can eat - but don't over order. They charge for food that is ordered and not eaten to prevent patrons from wasting food. No doggie bags.  Everything was spotlessly clean and the service is professional.

For those familiar, hotpot is a style of eating where your table has a pot of boiling spicy broth, and you order various raw meats and vegetables to dunk...into the broth (Korean BBQ but with broth instead of a grill).    The Happy Lamb does offer an ala-carte option, but if you're doing that at hotpot, you're doing it wrong.  Go for the ""All You Cant Eat"" option.  $30 per person (including tip, unless you want booze with your meal).    To start with you'll be given a menu with all of the various meat/veg options for you to check off what you want.  Go nuts, order a much as you think you can stomach.  Get ALL of the variety.  There is a decision to be made here though.  Be warned that there are no ""sample-size"" portions.  If you order the fatty beef, they're going to bring you a TON of it.  It's all you can eat, but they warn up front that if you leave more than 5oz of anything uneaten they'll weight it and charge you for it.  I'm a fat kit, I ordered probably 6 different meats and 10 different veggies, and still managed to put it all down plus more.  The first and most important selection though is your broth.  They have a basic bone broth, or a spicy, or a ""half and half"" option.  I went with this, but if I had it to do over again I'd just go all spicy.  It's not uncomfortable hot, and it's got so much flavor.    What makes this place so great is the quality.  For $30 all you can eat meat, you're not expecting the best meat possible.  But you'd be wrong.  Top-notch quality on everything.  I honestly don't know how they stay in business with those prices.    The stand outs for me were the fatty beef and the lamb.  Great quality, phenomenal flavor, and sliced so thing that it cooks with just a few seconds dunk in the broth.    When you're done having one of the best meals of your life, step outside and explore Chicago's beautiful China town.  So much flavor, so much culture, if you Chicago this is a MUST EAT.More"

We were impressed with the friendly wait staff and the comfortable decor. Now we will visit regularly. It's off the touristy beaten track in Chinatown and if you've never done hot pot before here's a few tips. Plan on a little more time than a usual dinner out. Sip your complimentary tea while you check off the items you want. Don't fall for the all you can eat. You will have all you can eat with the regular hot pot menu! The spicy broth is delicious but almost too much of a good thing. Spend the extra and get the combo which is both types of broth in a divided pot. Order the veggie platter which appears to be the entire leafy green section of your grocery, but cooks down and makes the soup very tasty. You only need one type of meat. We over ordered by selecting the lamb/beef and chicken. The platters are piled high with thinly shaved meat that cooks quickly. Noodles are a must. The wide are delicious. Mushrooms are worthwhile. You can order the dipping sauces for no charge and those are awesome for flavoring the soup in your bowl. We loved the garlic and the sesame. By the time you are satisfied you will hate to leave your beautiful broth behind."

Not a hello, how are you, nothing welcoming!!! As a matter of fact, we couldn't get one employee to smile. We were probably there for 1 1/2 hrs and not once did the server come over to see if we needed anything. That's why she got the offensive tip. The venue is so very dirty outside as it is inside. The windows looked like they've NEVER been cleaned. The women's restroom had two stalls (one was disgusting). If you're a germaphobic..do not come here. Food was good but couldn't stop thinking whether kitchen area passed health inspection. YUK! We picked this place because of Yelp reviews.

Owned by Joyce Chiu and brother Matthew, their no-frills...approach to Pastries, Cakes, Buns and more having additionally entered Uptown with further expansion planned, it is from 7:00am until 8:00pm daily that guests are welcomed – COVID-19 currently seeing extra safety measures implemented at a space that already appears quite clean.  Cash only then and now, with dining area currently closed but take-out sales faring well thanks to Chiu Quon's recent partnership with Facebook advertising, it is from over 100 daily items that diners must make choices, many of them identifiable to those familiar with Chinese Cuisine but others previously unseen.  Purporting to use “the finest Ingredients,” a dubious statement considering the low price point, it was at a cost of just under $17 that ten choices were bagged, a lack of seating finding the Taro Bun enjoyed on nearby church steps while Black Sesame baked similarly had an unpleasant gelatinous center as though it was undercooked.  Next sampling a refrigerated Walnut Bean Paste Cake, the Pastry on this as well as a “mini” Moon Cake buttery around well-textured Filling, suffice it to say that arriving immediately after Egg Custard Tarts emerged from the oven was fortuitous – both Hong Kong and Portuguese styles still jiggly with *better* largely a matter of personal taste.  Taking a chance or two before finishing familiar, Chiu Quon’s Sesame Pork Cookie undoubtedly an acquired taste, it seems hard to believe anyone might enjoy a “Peanut Rice Cake” that eats like sawdust in a flavorless Hostess Snoball, a far better taste and value offered by textbook Sesame Balls or golden Dough baked around subtly sweet Lotus Paste.More"

Three reasons why my review rating is not as high as it should be; the portions were too small, White Rice was not included with any of our dishes, and the server was adequate but rather sullen and indifferent.

Now that I have my background established I've had several of MCCB's dishes from  Caviar's takeout service. Pork fried rice, crab rangoon, honey black pepper bone in short rib rice (they're stingy about the meat for this dish), orange chicken (average).

If there is a better source for fried seafood in Chicago, it hasn't been identified. Located at 2120 South Canal Street, Lawrence's offers signature shrimp, fried or boiled or smoked, with a big outdoor patio and...large private dock that is available to boaters on a Dock & Dine basis. The business is so popular that Lawrence's has expanded to locations at 3242 West 87th Street in the Westport Commons Shopping Center, at 850 West Superior, 50 South Mannheim Road in Hillside and 908 East Roosevelt Road in Lombard. On Canal Street, on the south bank of the Chicago River, north of Cermak, south of 18th Street, Lawrence's is open 24/7. Over the years, we have established a standing order, one pound of large wild caught Gulf shrimp brined and breaded using a family recipe with potato salad and macaroni salad and fish and chips, one pound of boneless, skinless wild caught Alaskan pollock fillets freshly breaded in house with tartar sauce. Don't forget the banana pudding for dessert.More"

The staff was beyond unprofessional. Front staff (order taker) talked more to the people standing around and staff then to myself and partner who was trying to place an order...(which meant I had to keep repeat myself). The kitchen staff doesn't know what they are doing why? would you cook everything that takes a few minutes to cook first (fries, shrimp) first and drop whole catfish which for them took over 15-30 minutes to cook last....so everything but the one piece of my meal is cold.  No plastic wear in the bag nor in site. Until I noticed the shirts and hair nets I thought they were paying customers... staff in the back corner either working, hanging out or just being unprofessional were cussing, yelling and for a second thought I was in a rap video.   The food was okay to me...corn fritters didn't have any corn, catfish really no seasoning but coconut shrimp we're very delicious. My partner didn't complain about anything but the temperature but after a 45 minute wait for what we got...he accepted it and he was rasied here, so may be use to bad services and cold food. Locals maybe use to this behavior but for an visitor....I don't plan to be back.More"

Afterward, it was our choice--Lawrence's Fish & Shrimp or a hamburger joint....Shrimp usually won, especially the large peeled a la shrimp cocktail and lightly breaded or French fried variety. Located at 2120 South Canal Street on Chicago's near South Side, Lawrence's has been satisfying seafood lovers since 1950. But shrimp is their speciality...large, breaded, coconut or popcorn. With fries and slaw. And cap it off with banana pudding or strawberry cheesecake. Wash it all down with a soft drink or lemonade. If you're in a mood for something other than shrimp--it's hard to imagine why--there are several tasty and healthy options, including cod, ocean perch, catfish, fish chips, clams, crab cakes, oysters and scallops. Chicken, too. How about a shrimp Po'Boy sandwich? Nothing fancy here. Order at the counter, pick it up when it's ready, find a table and enjoy a hot and fresh meal.

I have been an extremely happy customer for four years, until today. Don’t get me wrong - the food is great, its just some of the people who work there that are the problem.. My husband called to make a reservation...for today (we have always done this same EXACT thing EVERY single time we went previously  - many times) and was told that they do not take reservations the day of. I instantly asked why he didn’t say that we have always done this, so he called and tried again, only to be told the same thing. Then I called myself and got the same response. I told the lady that what she is saying is not true, as I have always been able to make one the day of. She told me that she doesn’t know who I talked to before, but that they don’t take reservations for the same day ever since they have been open. I simply told her that that’s a lie because I have always been able to do this, then she HUNG UP! I called right back, expecting her to answer again, but another girl answered. I immediately told her how rude it was of the lady I spoke with last to hang up on me and explained my situation. She gave me the same response. I told her I don’t understand how I have always been able to make a reservation the day of, when they have never made them? 🤔 She then proceeded to tell me that it was the owner who I spoke with and that the owner says they have never taken reservations the day of. So I asked her, “that was the owner that I spoke with?! That is how the owner treats her customers? She hangs up on people?!” Then she told me that it was not the owner, but a hostess that I spoke with. So she literally lied to me, and I called her out about it. I then asked to speak with the owner or the manager, and she said that she just spoke with the owner and she told her they don’t take reservations day of. I said to her that she was lying again because how could she have just spoken with the owner if she was on the phone with me the whole time?! She then proceeded to lie that the owner was standing next to her and could hear our conversation (I did not hear anyone in the background) so I asked her to put the owner on the phone or at least to say say something out loud so that I know she is there. She then again went on about how she’s sorry, and that they don’t take reservations the day of. I told her that I will be writing a review and that I (unfortunately) will not be coming back ever again! I asked for her name and she said something like “Nium” (maybe Nhung is the correct spelling - not sure) so I asked her to spell it for me and she kept going on with how she’s sorry, blah blah blah. I asked her again to spell her name, she refused to tell me, and then hung up. Needless to say, over something SO dumb, I will not be back. Any establishment that I bring business to (nonetheless bring friends and family to) that will willingly lie and treat the customer this way, doesn’t deserve my business!!!More"

It's up a flight of stairs on the upper level of the Chinatown Square Mall.  It's a huge room, like a banquet...hall,  with many tables for 8. At 12:45pm the place was bustling and we had about a 5-minute wait for a 2-top.  They give you a menu w/ little photos of the dim sum on offer and this is why I wonder if there's a factory off-site producing them for multiple restaurants: the menu is very similar or maybe even identical to MingHin's and other Chinese restaurants we've eaten at.  After perusing the menu, we ordered 4 dim sum plates and an entree-size plate of seafood w/ mushrooms.  The entree was easily the best dish with shrimp, squid and pieces of scallop in addition to 3 kinds of mushrooms and celery (a lot), snow peas, scallion and carrot pieces.  My companion complained that it was not as flavorful as he would like but I enjoyed it.  The skinny fried egg rolls had a nasty rancid taste to them.  The ""crystal dumplings w/ duck"" were filled w/ shrimp instead of duck and had a gelatinous coating (taro?) that made them extremely difficult to eat as they kept sliding out of the chopsticks until I cut them with a spoon.  The siu mai were pretty good.       This was a serviceable spot and if you choose carefully you can get a good meal.  It's not in any way outstanding, though.

The restaurant itself is quite small as it's situated in Chinatown Square. I wasn't familiar...with Chinatown so I didn't know that it was a smaller restaurant which made it a little awkward for us to try and fit my 7 month old's stroller into the restaurant. I'm disabled and we had taken the red line all the way from our hotel so there was no way I could have just carried her and left the stroller at the hotel.   Other than that the menu was easy to understand but quantity of dumplings in each order wasn't indicated (it's 8). I ordered the chicken soup dumpling and the shanghai style soup dumpling with pork and I split each with my friend. My husband got the sizzling teriyaki beef. The dumplings like I stated in the title were decent, not overly amazing but not horrible either. I'm accustomed to Din Tai Fung soup dumplings which are the gold standard for soup dumplings so I'm probably just picky. My husband said the sizzling teriyaki beef was good but despite the fact that it was quite hot temperature wise it tasted like it could have been cooked longer but it was enjoyable and there was no food left on our plates by the end of the night.More"

The soup has great flavor as well as the pork filling. I really loved the food. There are a few negatives: the waitress was not very helpful with the menu.

In Chicago recently for a conference, I had two windows of time, one dinner and one lunch. As McCormick place is a culinary...desert and Chinatown is nearby, I looked up what were the top 10 places in Chinatown and Golden Bull came up. That rating is correct: a nice but unassuming place that serves outstanding food and exotic ingredients if that's for you. They probably aren't exotic to Chinese people but readers will know what I mean. For example, for dinner I had a whole frog in yellow chives (they warned me about the bones) and fried pigeon and for lunch, something more conventional, a steamed farmer's chicken in a lotus leaf and fabulous baby clams in black bean sauce. Both served with perfect steamed rice. The staff recognized I was by myself and were very sweet; when I came back the next day, they greeted me like an old friend; pretty good for Chinatown where warm greetings and friendliness aren't always the norms. It's good value for the money and the menu is extensive with anything from Cantonese noodles to egg foo yung in the old style and Singapore noodles in the new -- and everything in between. Golden Bull is both a destination and the type of place you'd love to find if at some big conference at McCormick Place. I was so glad I went.More"

There were rows and rows of shops, cafes, and restaurants, full of choices! After numerous of climbing steps,there were many people, tourists, and locals walking around. Stores and shops were full of people.Since I was both tired and hungry, I checked out Saint's Alp's. The café is small, but clean and modern with a 2nd floor. I didnt wait long and then I went in. I was promptly served with menu and ice water. I checked the menu. Its a Taiwan fused with Japanese and Chinese influences on the cuisines.

I'd done some research ahead of time on places to eat but, like the dunderhead...I can be sometimes, I forgot to bring the list along on the trip, so after we arrived and parked (yes, we found a spot - a miracle!) and went up and down Wentworth and Cermak looking to see if anything rang any bells in my head, we walked by Three Happiness, saw the Zagat/other local reviews and decided, ""what the heck"". The place is pretty time-worn, but it was packed with Sunday revelers and folks on the whole looked happy, so we attacked the menu and, after being told that two of the items we wanted were ""out"" (it was just before noon that day), we ordered several dishes (two types of appetizers, hot/sour soup, veggie egg foo young, shrimp with broccoli and noodles, etc.) that sounded like they'd make us happy. Soon after ordering, the nice man came back and said that one of the appetizers we'd ordered was also ""out"", so we chose another (stuffed green peppers) and drank some tea while watching the Bears on a nearby TV. The appetizers came out and were met with mixed reviews (not sure exactly what the peppers were stuffed with - it looked like minced shrimp - but the texture was a bit slimy). Soon after, the shrimp dish arrived and it was pretty good, loaded with decent-sized shrimps and Chinese broccoli. Then the EFY arrived - three large patties - along with what was perhaps the gloppiest gravy we'd ever seen. By itself, it was just OK, but adding a bit of hot sauce improved that dish 100%. It was only then, after the mains showed up, that I got my hot/sour soup - a generous bowl, pretty nicely made. So, I'm not sure exactly what to make of this place. Some things were fair, some weird, some better-than-good, and the prices were reasonable, but with so many other highly-rated places nearby, I'm pretty sure I wouldn't go back. Also, the men's bathroom was very small and pretty grungy. We did walk around the neighborhood (the nearby riverfront park and pagoda were just beautiful) and found a Tous Les Jours bakery nearby, so after some great pastries and tea there, we ended the afternoon in a pretty good mood.More"

The food has always been hot and fresh. The service quick and friendly. But for some reason, this visit was different. We arrived at 11:15 a.m. We ordered about 8 dim...sum dishes. No rice was brought to the table like in years past. The first dish was served at 11:45 a.m. Let me just cite that everyone around us, who came in after, was served before us. Sitting for 45 minutes watching other parties being served ther hot bowls of rice was more than frustrating because, of all things, rice is cooked in great quantities. When we asked the hostess if she could check on our order, she didn't even flinch. She looked at us as if we were the inconvenience, but she's had that smug look on her face for many years. When we inquired about our order a second time, it was apparently my fault for the delay in our order because I ordered egg drop soup, which was not dim sum. This explanation was not acceptable, as I have ordered soup with dim sum every time with no delay of other dishes for the past 16 years. When we asked a third time, our shrimp toast, my absolute favorite, was burned to a crisp. They sent a message that for some reason, we would not receive service. We asked if we did something wrong. Then we asked if they would rather us leave and they didn't hesitate to say yes. There were 5 of us, 2 women and 3 children. There are many places for dim sum in China Town, and for more than half my life I have chosen this particular restaurant.

Based on reviews we narrowed down either here or Phoenix round the corner. A local told us that Phoenix had an hour wait so we opted for Three Happiness, and even though the restaurant and everywhere else was busy we were seated straight away. We were also given chinese tea and water on arrival (which were great little touches). However when it came to ordering we were really put off. The menu selection was really good and even though there was only 2 of us we wanted to order about 7/8 dishes (and was willing to take back to hotel). However about 4 dishes in the guy told us we were ordering too much food and when I said we would bag up the leftovers he got really defensive and funny with us. That didn't go down well, and when the food came out it was slow between dishes (rather than together) and in a random order (for example rice first then 5 mins later we would got our meat). We actually didn't receive one dish in the end which I asked to be taken off the bill. I expected it to be busy which it was but you could see with floods of people coming in and takeaway orders too, the staff were completely overwhelmed to stay on top. The quality of the food we did get was ok and the prices are very good, however it was a shame as we thought this place would be a hidden gem and after not receiving half the food we wanted, I regret coming here and wish I waited the extra time at phoenix."

We all shared the shrimp with black bean sauce, the satay beef, the chicken with cashews, and the pork fried rice. When the food arrived, we initially thought that we had ordered too much as the portions were quite ample. However, the food was so good that hardly a scrap was left over. All the dishes were well prepared and tasty, but I especially liked the shrimp because of its very flavorful sauce. The service was efficient and courteous.Pay-to-park lots and metered street parking are available.

The larger Three Happiness on Wentworth has excellent dim sum, though everything else there is ordinary. I haven't had dim sum at this location (and don't know if they serve it), but the regular Cantonese fare is decent but ordinary. There are many better choices (Phoenix, Cai) for this type of cuisine in Chicago's Chinatown, with more crisp and fresher vegetables and less tired ingredients.

One's got to turn sideways to get through the tiny doors to the bathroom. It's hard to find a place to park on the street and street meter parking is expensive. On the way to and from the restaurant there's a good chance a panhandler will ask for money. And believe me when I say all the hassles are worth it. The food here is wonderfully tasty and extremely moderately priced. Try the egg rolls, which are HUGE and oh-so-good. Here's all one really needs to know about this place...it's where Chicago police come to get carry-out during their breaks while on duty, especially late at night and well after midnight. You'll feel stuffed when you leave and you may want to thumb your nose at the much-more-expensive restaurants in the area that have a lot more atmosphere. I've been here countless times when passing through Chicago at all hours and the stop is always worth it.

The food was fantastic we had the dumplings, chicken wings, fried rice and two specialty noodles (flat noodles with seafood and pork noodles).

Such an easy walk from South Loop or McCormick Place. $2 validated parking for 3 hours at closeby Chinatown parking lots if you need to drive. Lunch specials are less than $10 and that includes 8 dishes of unique Korean sides. Loved the fish cakes (very mild and flavorful) and the potatoes (sweet and white in a lovely seasoned sauce). My main dish was the Jajangmyun, a black bean dish with potatoes, zucchini and onions. Friends got the BibimBop, a beautiful bowl of mixed veggies, rice and protein of your choice with a fried egg on top.

However, we were served eight different side dishes that we snacked on while we waited for our orders. The kimchi served as a side dish was definately the best kimchi I have ever had. I ordered the stir-fried squid and pork upon recommendation from the waiter. For some reason, my food did not come out with the rest of my party's food and I had to wait some time for my food. However, the waiter did sincerely apologize several times and offered me more side dishes along with a free drink for my wait. Once my food did come, it was quite good. The pork and squid were not overcooked and the sauce was delicious. The rest of my party enjoyed their food as well. I don't know if I would say this is the BEST Korean restaurant in Chicago (I mean I haven't eaten at them all yet), but the kimchi is the best I have ever had.

When the food came, it was good, but we had to ask for everything even though we had said that we intended to share every dish we had ordered. Please can we have plates. Please can we have bowls for the soup. Please can we have a ladle for the soup. When they asked if we'd like more drinks, we ordered more water and another hot tea. The water came immediately. I had to ask for the tea 3 times but it still never came. I gave up in the end. We didn't have to ask twice for the check though. That came PDQ!

Within a few minutes, the waiter brought me my side dishes, all of which were quite flavorful.Ten minutes or so later, my main course arrived.

I snagged the first table near the window that allows you to lean against the wall. Yelp has a coupon for a free Korean drink which is very interesting - a very pulpy juice from a can.

The 554 is listed on the menu under its official description: BBQ pork with fried eggs over rice. It's a small oval platter heaped high with fluffy, steamed white rice, smothered on one side by fatty slices of red-hued char siu (or barbecued pork) and on the other side by two fried eggs, splashed with dark soy sauce. I was informed that the code name is a holdover from the dish's number on a former menu and it was added to the Urban Dictionary by several late-night diners. What is the Urban Dictionary? It is a crowd-sourced online dictionary of slang words, cultural words and phrases that are not typically found in standard dictionaries. It was founded in 1998 as a parody of dictionary.com and vocabulary.com. When a dish makes the UD, you have to try it. Which we did. Take it from a guy who thinks Cantonese is a name for people who live in Canton, Ohio, 554 is a different but delicious and irresistible dish."

In case you didn't know, chow fun is wide rice noodles, sometimes prepared in soup, dry fry or with gravy. Chicago chow fun is fried and prepared with a variety of toppings with gravy. The key is the in frying where -- and this is where ""Chicago-style chow fun"" excels -- the noodles are chewy, sticky and partially crispy. When the gravy topping is added -- could be fish or other meat -- the noodles just explode with flavor and eating pleasure. It all happens in the mouth as you chew and crunch the noodles. Seven Treasure, in my experience, is one of the best places for Chicago-style chow fun. They also have rice dishes and other entrees, all of which are good to very good, although for some reason, vegetables in Chicago Chinatown are expensive. Restaurant has undergone some renovation over the 30+ years I have dropped by, but it still retains a simple, understated, non-elegant atmosphere: clean baths, cab-like services (i.e., need to hail them as they pass by), and with booths removed.

On the last two occasions, appetizers were brought out with the meal rather than before it, and once, they were brought out only after we asked about them. They installed new tables for hotpots. These are uncomfortable; they have a shelf under them that sits so low that I had to sit sideways because my legs would not fit.

There are so many restaurants to choose from, we chose the closest one to where we parked the car. We made an excellent choice with House of Fortune.We ordered the Family Dinner for 3. The soup of the day was a traditional Egg Drop soup that came out very hot and fast.The Spring Roll came out crunchy on the outside yet moist and delicious on the inside, along with Crab Rangoon which had enough crab to taste and was very slightly sweet. These were served with a small dish of duck sauce and a small dish of hot mustard.The Lemon Chicken was cooked just right and was extremely good and zesty; very sweet and very good. The Beef with Vegetable had large pieces of freshly cooked vegetables and came in a slightly pungent brown sauce which as terrific. We substituted the Shrimp with Lobster Sauce with Spicy Pork and we were not disappointed. We were quite happy that they allowed the substitution to the Family Dinner without any disagreement.The staff was very attentive, the prices are reasonable, and the food is great. They have a full bar and the drinks are also reasonably priced. They are the first Chinese restaurant that I have found that serves Lychee Wine by the glass."

We always order West Lake Beef Soup, it's not a traditional broth soup, it is a clear broth with pork, egg whites, cilantro but this restaurant added chopped mushrooms. If it wasn't for the mushrooms I would have like it better but it was used as a filler, not much pork or cilantro. It was perfect for my husband who loves mushrooms.

If your not into the spicy food they serve a wide variety of foods from around China.   My suggestion for a visit, go with a group and order the dishes for the group and share them around one of the round tables with a spinning center. This is how they eat many of their meals in China. It may help, though not a must, to have someone familiar with the dishes since the accent can be tough to get through at times and there is a HUGE amount of dishes.

My wife had shrimp with Ginger and Scallions, also from Chinese Menu.  It was a cold night, so my son ordered Steamed Dumpling Soup from Chinese Menu, but was disappointed when the waiter brought only dumplings and sauce - explaining that the chef decided this was not a soup.  I am taking off a star for the waiter not telling us up-front.  My son also tried the Chinese canned beverage translated as Fruity Jelly Drink, which was sort of grape-colored with clear chewy bits which flowed into your mouth through the straw.

We all love Asian food. About half of our group liked the experience, but not me. Here’s why:  First of all, the choices of menus were difficult to understand....I don’t mean the food on the menu, I mean the menus themselves. There are two different menus, an all-you-can-eat and another one, and you can’t mix and match; if one of your group is starving and wants all-you-can-eat, everyone has to choose that much more expensive option. We had to ask for clarification of ordering instructions over three times. You may have to wait for someone that speaks English well enough to explain it to you, and then you might still not quite understand what happened until you get the check. I am a college graduate and experienced world traveler, and I still had difficulty.   The food choices are not explained well. Three types of lamb and beef were on the menu, each with descriptors such as “supreme” and “extra special” with different pricing, but no other information to help you decide which you want. We ended up getting one of each and could not tell any difference whatsoever when they were brought to the table. There were scallops and shrimp, which were easy to understand, and ended up being my favorites, my poor brain being too confused. The food itself was obviously very fresh, which is the only good thing I can mention.  Service was awful. We arrived between lunch and dinner, when there were only a few other parties in the whole place, but we had a long wait for each request, not only to receive what we requested (such as drink refills or chopsticks), but to catch a staffer even to ask in the first place!  The hot pot cooking method was fine; I have no problem with that. But give me enough information to choose the foods I want to cook there, and not question what the hell’s going on.More"

I have lived in China full time for the last ten years, and have eaten at plenty of hot pot restaurants. My wife, who is Chinese, also thought it was pretty good.   For those of you that don't know...about hot pot, the waiters will serve you raw food, you will cook it yourself, you will share a pot with other people, and it will be spicy (I personally thought it was not that hot).   Why is it not entirely authentic? 1. The meat is better than the meat in China (good thing). 2. The super spicy hot pot was not that hot (in addition to my wife, my sister and her boyfriend who have never eaten hot pot were able to eat it without a problem (bad thing). 3. The service is not as good as the hot pot restaurants in China (Hai Di Lao, La Fu, Ba Nv). There were only two waiters when we were there. However, this is not really a complaint. You don't need a waiter to enjoy a hot pot experience.  Looking at the menu of the other Little Sheep, which is right around the corner, Little Lamb had much more items on the menu. Little Sheep had maybe 18 things on the menu (not enough for hot pot). While it is the more famous hot pot restaurant in China, they have clearly Americanized the menu (boring)!  Overall, my family and I had a great time and felt stuffed. Everyone should really try hot pot, because it is primarily meat and vegetables in soup. I can't give Little Lamb a five because the hot pot wasn't that spicy. But that doesn't mean that others won't think it is spicy. Have fun and give something different a try!More"

Service improved once our order was placed and the Pho was good and had well-developed flavors.   My husband said his soft-shelled crabs were almost “off”.  I guess this place, while it has many items including Thai dishes, is good for a bowl of hot pho at a cheap price with absolutely no frills dining.

Street parking can be scarce at times but just park in the big pay lot a block away or take the Red Line into the neighborhood.  If you're not sure what to order, there are photographs of the dishes all along the walls of the restaurant to help you make up your mind or you can watch what they're bringing out to other tables.  We had the #1 spring rolls and #5 Vietnamese pancakes for appetizers.  The #5 was an ABSOLUTELY AMAZING flavor explosion and I would be tempted to have this as my main dish sometime.  We had the beef pho soup and it was very, very good.  We also had the #27 fried egg noodle dish with chicken and it was also very, very good.  The restaurant was simple and clean.  The service was friendly and speedy.  We had to ask exactly how we were supposed to eat the #5 and they were very helpful (you wrap the pancake, carrots, cucumber and basil leaves up in a lettuce leaf and dip it into some heavenly sauce).  The cost is reasonable: appetizers are $3-$6 and mains are minimum $7.  It would be fun to have dinner here sometime and take advantage of the BYOB option.

Portions are large.  If you're not especially ravenous you may want to share your entrée.  We ordered fried squid and potstickers for appetizers.  The squid was almost melt-in-your-mouth good.  I know that sounds weird, considering squid can be chewy but the breading was light and the squid tender.  The potstickers were among the best I've ever had.  We both love noodles and had a hard time choosing.  I went with a Hong Kong style stir fry while my companion had the gummy noodles.  My noodles were similar to spaghetti in shape but that's where the similarity ended.  I could tell they were made fresh.  The sauce was delicious and the beef tender.  The gummy noodles turned out to be chow fun, which we hadn't had in quite a while (non of our local Chinese places serve it).  It was so good.  We are good eaters but neither of us could finish our plates.  Were we not in a hotel without a microwave we would have taken the leftovers with us.

We determined that there was a party room upstairs and reserved a table for 12 for my upcoming birthday. One week ago we ate there again and found out that they had no record of the reservation; we re-made it. Yesterday I phoned and again was told that they had no record of a reservation; again I re-made it. Today they did have the table ready, but the service was only fair to poor. Only one waitress was assigned to us, and we continually had to ask for things that should have been pretty obvious, like re-filling the rice bowl. Tea was never provided. We started eating at 4 pm on Saturday, hardly a particularly busy time.I really don't think the waitress had a communication problem; her English was very good.The food was pretty good. My one concern with this restaurant is that a lot of what they deep-fry (which they do very well) tends to be terribly over-breaded. Yesterday I tried to fax our desired order to the restaurant, only to find that the fax number had been disconnected. I asked for the phone number of Tony Hu, the owner of this and a bunch of other Chinatown-Chicago restaurants, and was given a number that is not in service.In all, I'd recommend this restaurant for its food but don't go expecting very attentive service."

The noodles are hand made, the sauces are divine. The baby bok choy with mushrooms is the essence of elegance. The lamb omg. And I can't forget the soup dumplings, which is why we went in the beginning. Oh, why was Good Friday important. The velvet scallops. I can still remember how they tasted. Ah, what a restaurant."

We walked in and found a seat for ourselves right by the door. We have visited China five times so we were hoping for the authentic flavored we knew from our trips. It was not but it was also better than the typical Chinese we get here in the states. Hands down, the best dish we had was the chive dumplings. They are boiled and the wrap is so deliciously soft. The filling tastes very authentic and yummy. The ma po tofu was beautiful but just way too hot (I had requested medium but it was still too hot). The tofu noodles with chicken were delicate and Tony's special dumplings were ok. One recommendation is to avoid the pork potstickers. They had no flavor and the dough was thicker than I use at home. Interestingly, the sesame chicken was fabulous and I did not think much of it when it was ordered as that is typically such a sweet dish here. We would try this restaurant again or probably Lao Shanghai."

If in Chicago take the Red Line...to the Cermak-Chinatown station and exit to the West.  Cross South Wentworth and at South Archer enter the Chinatown Square Plaza.  There you will find Lee Wing Wah across the aisle from American Metro Bank.  Lots of comfortable seating and a big menu.  Good, efficient service (the staff speaks English, Cantonese and Mandarin).  I had the fish fillets with ong choy (a Chinese vegetable somewhat similar to spinch) - generous portion.  For an appetizer try the chicken wings or the fried shrimp.  Their West Lake beef soup or seafood and tofu soup are excellent choices.  Large selection of poultry (chicken, duck or quail), beef, pork and seafood dishes.  My favs are the steamed chicken with mushrooms, steamed salted fish with pork patty, honey walnut shrimp, stir fried clams in black bean sauce, beef with foo gwah (bitter melon - only true Chinese eat this!), salted frog legs, Hong Kong style quail, oyster with ginger and shallots, and the beef stew or casserole.   You can also get a wide assortment of chow mein, chow fun and fried rice.  For those in the know, try the Chinese porridge (many varieties) or congee.  Be sure to ask for the  Chinese ""donut"" or ""yaw jow gwuy"" to go with the porridge. Hot tea is the customary beverage with Chinese cuisine but if you want something cool, they offer a wide assortment of fresh fruit smoothies.  They also offer set menus for larger groups or if you rather they select your meal.  But going a la carte is best.  Open everyday for lunch and dinner with a take out service.   If you need a late night meal, they are open to 10 pm.More"
