I’d been here before but it was great to hear them praise the food so much, and it did not disappoint. We ordered several rounds of tapas and did not regret any of the choices. This is an amazing place if you like to eat “family style”."

My friend and I both ended up putting our winter hats and coats back on during the entire meal. For as popular and highly sought after that this place is, it was unacceptable to have this type of experience. I would suggest getting only take-out at this location, unless you enjoy eating meals feeling like you are in a cold, dungeon. Maybe we were just put in the wrong part of the restaurant, but it is hard to tell if other spots were better heated. Not a great first experience."

Turns out that this ""cafe"" has plenty of outdoor dining area and even bigger inside seating. Our friend familiar with this Windy City told us it was a fun place to go. We agree, the inside ambiance was just so mellow with versions of Picasso covering the walls to complement Spanish ham dangling by the entrance.Here's how we'd rate the tapas we ordered:Item #31 - stuffed mushroom, came piping hot and delicious - 5 starsitem #52 - beef empanada, also piping hot and tasty - 5 starsitem #43 - octopus with potatoes, stayed hot, perfectly tender and great flavor, the best of our order - 5 starsitem #64 - fried chicken thighs, tender and tasty - 5 starsItem #61 - iberico charcuterie, despite being among chef's recommendations, it was quite unexceptional and deserve a rating not higher than 3 starsCatalan ""crystal bread,"" because of tomato puree topping, the bread was soggy and worthy of barely 2 starsI thought the price was reasonable for the quality of food and does not deserve $$$$ as some have rated."

We have patronized other restaurants in this chain for years and always found them welcoming with friendly service. Not this time. My wife and I stopped to have lunch and before we could reach the isolated reception desk the receptionist barked that I had to put on a mask. I was already in fact pulling it over my chin to cover my nose. We elected to dine at a table in adjacent bar, but she lectured us 1st that we had to cover don our masks whenever staff came to the table, We said we would not and elected to leave when she said, ""I'm sorry you don't care about our safety"" This obvious millennial was snotty in a condescending manner which was offensive. If this restaurant wants to return to pre-pandemic business they wiil need to do a better job of training employees in appropriate customer service."

My daughter and I split Garlic Potato Salad; Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli; Brussels Sprouts Salad with Marcona Almond, Manchego Cheese (for balance, lol); Spinach & Manchego Stuffed Mushrooms and Goat Cheese Baked in Tomato Sauce. I had the Iberia Ham Croquetas all to myself. While it wasn’t the healthiest dinner I’ve ever had, everything was very tasty and well made. Brussels sprouts salad is new find for me - I really hate the taste of cooked Brussels sprouts, but raw and cut up thin for a salad - delicious! This is fun food. Side note, we had one small issue which management was very gracious about and fixed right away. "

Because of the pandemic my temperature was taken first and I advise everyone reading this review to make advanced reservations if you prefer outside seating while summer lasts.Regardless service here was excellent. I ordered a tiny deviled egg, a wrapped date and bacon, tomato bread, grilled spicy potatoes with aioli sauce and grilled calamari. It was actually way too much food for me but I loved the textures, presentation and taste of every tapas I ordered. A warning though-- the grilled potatoes are decadent but made for sharing because it's extremely rich so if you order the spicy potatoes just don't overdo it or share with a good friend or your date. If you want the best value come here between 4pm till 6pm where happy hour is extremely well priced but seating is first come first served and you will be seated strictly at the bar for the happy hour price.My soda was refilled and my server was very good with bringing everything to me quickly and attending to my needs.Sorry for the dark photos of my food but honestly the restaurant was extremely dark.I highly recommend the tasty tomato bread and calamari. This tapas restaurant is definitely my first choice in all of Chicago!"

We scooped it up and were on our way. It is VERY apparent why it’s so hard to get in. The tapas menu offers a great variety of vegetarian, seafood, and meats. We felt like we ordered half the menu, and still had a dozen items we wanted to try. The spicy potatoes are great, but be careful not to fill up on them. ALWAYS order grilled octopus when you see it on a menu. The peach sangria was refreshing and turned out to be a good value at $28 per pitcher. We were able to get six glasses poured. Service was attentive, and the patio had great vibes."

The sangria is always a favorite and we are choosy about our sangria. The blue cheese beef is one of our favorites as well as the patatas bravas. This time we tried the seafood paella and it was not the flavor that we liked, so disappointed. We took it home thinking it might improve with age or we might like it better, nope...ended up throwing it out. Normally, we really enjoy paella just not here."

This place has all small plates that is intended to be shared with the table. They suggest 2-3 small plates per person.

The place is quite large and is crowded even in the late afternoon. The menu is hit or miss: the Brussels sprout salad was crisp and refreshing; the Spanish omelette was flavorful and not dry; but the paella came out wrong and the sweet potato soup tasted off. Our server was almost oblivious - she knew nothing about the wine list and didn’t bother to pour our wine. I’ve definitely had better service at a fast food restaurant. Don’t waste your time or $$ if you’re looking for a special experience.

The papas Bravas were horrible.The pulpo was a scam, they put more potato’s than pulpo. The paella was akin to a fried rice from a cheap Chinese restaurant, albeit in minuscule or European portions. The bread was cold and stale. The only good thing was the sangria and the ambiance, which was very cozy. I loved the faux Picasso murals. In sum, it is a nice place to have drinks, but avoid it if you are into real Tapas."

We love the variety of tapas that we have to choose from; we've had tortilla espanola, ham croquetas, baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, plato de la casa - just to name a few dishes that we've tried. Everything we've tried has been very good. For people who have never been to a tapas restaurant, it's always good to go with a larger group, that way you can pick a larger variety of tapas to see what you like. Our servers have also been very good; they know when to come by to see if we want to order another round of tapas, or another drink. Also, a personal observation - I see other restaurant guests who order Miller Lite, Coors Light, etc. - I wish that they would step out of their comfort zone and order a Spanish beer (Estrella Damm), or a glass of Spanish wine - they don't know what they're missing!!

Food - 2Would not say that the Spanish food here is authentic or of high quality. Several of the dishes skimp out to give a quick meal in the masses. Biggest example is the bacon wrapped dates, thin crispy bacon wrapped in olive size dates. Where you would expect thick cut bacon wrapped in plum sized dates. Most dishes are overly sauced or drenched in oil. Service - 2Since they are cramming as many tables in this place as possible, the wait staff is overwhelmed by the number of tables they service and being tapas style their table visit count should be higher and quicker. Overall they are just slow. Atmosphere - 3Don’t come here with any anticipation of a fancy quiet meal. This is completely the opposite. Very noisy and crowded. If you want a rambunctious crowd with a vibrant feel, this is the spot. You will be crammed into this place but it will be a spot if your company is a little dull and a little distraction is needed. Would not return to this location. If you are looking for smaller intimate tapas fare Avec would be recommended."

I'm not sure if they advertise as a Spanish restaurant although, they do the small plates in the Spanish style and they do a good job of it but, I wouldn't confuse them with being a Spanish restaurant.

And I can tell you apart from the wine there is nothing Spanish about this restaurant or it’s food. The cheese platter has non Spanish cheese the heirloom tomatoes salad is a joke and more of a side dish and the grilled squid is swimming in oil. More like a pil-pil. The staff have really no clue as they will serve you a muga rosado at room temperature. I guess it all makes sense when you read the paella recipes. Seafood paella with mussels out of a can and fennel ???? They also have a paella with confit pork shoulder. Try to find these items in any restaurant in valencia or any other place in Spain for that matter. I guess as the chef is from Sweden (Jorgenson) that’s what to expect.

It is a busy place and that will make your experience better than waiting. Excellent wine list with some great Spanish options. The tapas and pintxos are very good. We enjoyed the stuffed olive with white anchovy's very much as well as the goat cheese in tomato sauce. The octopus was very tender. I had the white wine flight and would recommend that to anyone that wanted to try several options with varying taste profiles and styles. The service was prompt and attentive. Our server was very knowledgable of all of the menu items. The environment is very lively. As with most places that are busy it can be loud but that is to be expected. I could have done without the tv's in the dining area I was in. That is for a bar as far as I am concerned but I get it..Chicago...sports...whatever.

Ba Ba Reeba is a tapas joint and we just kept ordering small plate after small plate, pitcher of sangria after pitcher of sangria. I tried to keep up with pictures, but during a meal—a really good meal with fun people—you just have to let go and just be in the moment. I missed a couple dishes and I can’t remember them, but know that they were delicious. You can create a meal with a variety of tapas, or choose a selection as an appetizer and enjoy one of their paellas as your main course.We ordered the Burrata Cheese with Catalan Tomato Bread ($11); the bread was toasted crisp and paired with the cheese and sauce well. The Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli ($7.50) is a definite crowd pleaser with its tangy aioli and crispy-on-the-outside potato cubes and fluffy innards. The six of us had to arm wrestle for the three Bacalao Croquettes with Sherry Aioli ($2.50), but halved them and ordered more; this plate had a lot of flavor and good spice. Ba Ba Reeba’s infamous “Paella de Mariscos” with Shrimp, Squid, Preserved Mussels & Fennel ($17) was spectacular—true paella, cooked perfectly; you have to order it first, because it takes a while to make and then magically appears. Their Rioja-Braised Short Rib with Manchego Mashed Potatoes, Roasted Seasonal Vegetables & Rioja Wine Glaze ($14) was a show stopper; so tender and delicious, we tore into it before I could snap a picture. The Shrimp with Garlic, Olive Oil, Red Pepper Flakes ($9.50) was a solid plate with fresh, firm shrimp. My favorite plate was the Seared Scallops with Red Kuri Squash Purée, Maple Vinaigrette and Candied Pumpkin Seeds ($14); I would have ordered ten of these plates and been a happy man.My advice would be to make sure you leave room for dessert, which is hard to do because they have such a large, delicious offering of entree plates, you don’t want to stop. But stop, trust me. We ordered the Caramelized Banana ($3.50), with vanilla ice cream, quince syrup, and toasted pistachios; a great option to end a meal with a sweet, yet not-too-rich dessert. The Chocolate Truffle Cake ($3.50), with kahlua, whipped cream was rich and decadent—make sure your belly is ready for this delicous cake. Saving the best for last again was the Marcona Almond-Caramel Bar ($3.50) with whpped cream and a butter crust—YUM. This too was rich, so beware.This is a great place for couples, large groups, families, everything. You can order lots of small plates for every palette and picky eater. My only recommendation to Ba Ba Reeba is to get bigger tables—we had so many small plates, it was a glorious mess."

Johnny was our waiter and took good care of us. We decided to have a number of different tapas for our meal. We began with the bacon wrapped dates with the apple vinaigrette. The bacon is nicely browned and crunchy over the date and the saltiness and sweetness go wonderfully together. Our second tapas was the garlic potato salad - - sounds so plain right? Wrong! It is absolutely fantastic! It’s hard to describe how creamy and rich it is and like no other potato salad you’ve ever had. Our 3rd tapas was garlic shrimp. You get maybe 6 medium size shrimp laying in olive oil with lots of roasted garlic slices. The garlic is roasted so nicely that it is almost nutty in flavor. Our 4th tapas was the chicken and ham croquetas served with a aioli sauce - - crispy on the outside and the sauce is a great accompaniment to them. We also tried the Brussel sprout salad with candied marcona almonds and manchego cheese which was very good.Topped it all off with a pitcher of peach Sangria and we went away happy campers! Can’t wait to return.We had a party with 36 people here in January and the service and food were just wonderful! We had many of the tapas I mention above as well as chicken paella and the vegetarian paella which were delicious. I can’t remember our desserts but they were all a hit as well. Our guests loved the Bloody Mary Bar and people loved the Sangria and other mixed drinks they ordered. The room we reserved was very nice and we were able to bring in flower arrangements and decorations of our choice. They took really good care of us in every way. Allison was instrumental in all the planning and great to deal with.

Apps were good to very good. Octopus was a standout as was the spicy fried chicken thighs. We were really looking forward to the paella and it was a complete letdown.

We didn't have a reservation but were told by the hostess to come before 7pm for first-come-first-serve seating at the bar. It worked like a charm. We arrived at 6:45pm and were seated within 20 min. About 20 people arrived around 7pm so we were lucky to beat the rush. If you want to have guaranteed seating, I recommend reserving. We lived in Europe for several years and vacationed in Spain annually for the last 6 years as its my husband's favorite destination. So we have had very good tapas/pintxos, especially in Bilbao and San Sebastian. We thought the food at Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba was comparable, but the portions were small by Spanish standards, and the wine selection was not the best. We chose the brut cava instead. My husband also tried the red sangria, which he enjoyed. I'm not fond of sangria and found it too sour. You can get good beef in the numerous steakhouses in Chicago, but there are not too many places that serve Iberico pork (Iberian black pig with a strict acorn diet) so we decided to order more pork dishes. We sampled the chorizo-wrapped dates, seared cana de cabra (cheese), grilled Iberico pork, jamon Iberico plate, and grilled pulpo (octopus). My husband loved the dates, which I found too sweet. The seared cheese was nothing special. We wouldn't order it again nor recommend. The pulpo was excellent - not too heavy on the sauce or seasoning. While I really enjoyed the jamon Iberico, which was authentic and shipped from Spain, I couldn't justify paying $20 for 4 slices. The real winner was the grilled Iberico pork. Even a dull butter knife cut into the pork as if it were butter. It was so good (and the portion was so small with only 5 bite-size pieces) that we ordered another serving.Although we sat at the bar, it didn't feel crowded or noisy, and service was very good. Prices were reasonable by Chicago standards. Our meal for two costs $100 excluding alcohol. We would definitely return, as long as they serve Iberico pork."

The waitress was friendly and helpful in assisting us with determining how many of each tapa we needed to order for our group. In the end, we ordered a variety of tapas that included deviled eggs with crispy jamón serrano, spicy potatoes with tomato alioli, beef empanadas, chicken empanadas, Moroccan-spiced lamb kebabs with cucumber yogurt, grilled squid with olive oil and garlic, calamari with tomato crudo and jalapeno alioli, and grilled Ibérico pork with red chimichurri. A menu was left at our table in case we wanted to add to our order. As explained by our waitress, the tapas arrived at the table at different times based on when they were ready. The cadence in which the food was served gave us time to pass around the tapas without being overwhelmed by receiving too many plates at once. Overall, it was an excellent experience. The food was very good, and the most fun part was passing the tapas around person to person so everyone could taste some of each dish. It was much more than we expected from a late night meal. We left with not only with our appetites satisfied, but with great memories over our tapas experience - a new experience for most in our group."

It has been years since the last time I visited this restaurant but I have to say they have been and continue to be very consistent in every good way, quality, quantity, efficiency, pricing, etc. Their timing for delivery of your order is perfect and this is key in a Tapas restaurant, to soon and you have too many plates on the table, too late and your siting there with nothing to eat. The variety of cold and hot tapas is second to none and I can guarantee you that there is something to satisfy everyone's palate. There is parking on the street depending on the day and time of the week and there is always Valet parking available. There is a very large bar area where you can order drinks and food. I always recommend reservations for any evening, although this place is huge it is always packed, Anita will most likely be taking your call and she has been there for over 12 years which tells you a lot about this place, she is a sweetheart and efficient like everything in Ba-Ba Reeba's."

Passion fruit flavor was minimal unfortunately. Patatas Bravos tapas were great, as was the Queso de Cabra.

Item # 68 which is the pork ribs with the sherry glaze had been inexplicably taken off the menu . I don't know If there is someone sitting in an office somewhere making these decisions but whoever it is needs to rethink his/her decision . The pork ribs are BY FAR the Best item on the menu and the reason why I tell all my friends and family to visit the restaurant . I even told my date just wait til you have the last item ( saved the best for last ) when I realized it had been replace with a subpar choice . I asked to speak to a manager which is something I never do ( due to the fact that I work In the industry ), mike the manager came over and was very polite and professional and I appreciated his understanding . I would have given this restaurant 5 stars if it wasn't for this extremely poor choice of removing the pork ribs, but instead I only gave it 4.

The bavette was quite ok too. The mozza buffala was not good at all, i didnt like it. The tomatoes on the bread to go with had no flavor, had some thyme and salt. The chorizo salchichon and manchego was pretty good. Price are okay"

I organized to meet friends there, and was sorely disappointed. Parking is definitely a problem. You can hunt around the street, but be prepared for a long hunt. About the only option is the valet, so be prepared for $20 including tip.The restaurant is weirdly layed out. Big, as it wanders around into the far back recesses. But it is loud, tables are close together. Not a good environment for business discussion at all. And be prepared to have others listen to your conversation as you talk loudly due to the din, and proximity of other tables.Food is too expensive, and not that good. We ordered a selection of tapas. By Chicago standards, the portions were even smaller than usual. And at about $5-$10 each the price can add up quickly. The most important thing I can say is that 2 days after eating there I couldn't even remember what we ordered - just that ordinary.Every Spanish restaurant should have fantastic paella. But Ba-Ba-Reebas was not good at all. We found the dish to be terribly over-spiced, losing any sense of delicate flavors. After a few bits most people will have their fill, as the after-taste makes the paella less enticing with each bite.The Sangria is OK. And that's the best I can say. Sangria is a drink that reflects the atmosphere of the chef, and it can be quite good. But at Ba-Ba-Reeba it was a lot like what you buy in a bottle in the liquor store.If you don't live in the neighborhood this restaurant is hard to get to, has no parking, and mediocre food. I wouldn't make the drive again, as there are far better places to eat - and better Spanish restaurants in Chicago. Try Cafe Iberico - which is far better and less expensive."

We ordered the goat cheese baked in tomato sauce, spicy potatoes, beef tenderloin w/blue cheese, chorizo wrapped dates and cheese, seared salmon, and meatballs in tomato sauce. My 7 year old ordered the Mac n cheese from the kids menu. We also ordered a pitcher of red sangria.

They have beef, chicken, pork, veggie, and cheese options. My absolute favorite was the homemade beef empanada. The crust was so flaky, buttery, and had just enough bread to match the meet ratio inside. The pulled beef inside was flavorful and not dry at all. I wanted to order another one but had to save room for olives, cheese plate, chicken thighs, steak, and deviled eggs. I loved everything. Waitress, Madilyn ( I believe) was so nice and helpful, she suggested the chicken thighs which were great. Buttermilk fried with a yogurt harissa sauce, and a salad with celery, onion, radish, and carrots. May sound weird, but it was an amazingly refreshing combo. We also tried the squash blossom frittata which I especially liked because of the flavor of the roasted veggies inside (zucchini, peppers, onion) and the wonderful avocado sauce on top."

However, once we got in and got seated, my crabbiness disappeared.I don't give excellent ratings easily because any place I visit or stay at must pass certain criteria. In this case, because I have been to Spain so often and love Spanish cuisine, they had a high bar to meet. I was not disappointed. We had an excellent meal made up of a handful of different tapas and washed down with sangría.Very great staff. Our waitress missed part of the order - she brought a full pitcher of sangría when we ordered half. No problem - we were able to keep the full pitcher for the price of the half. I am pretty sure this accounted for the fact that I wasn't crabby walking that mile + to get back to the L. It also accounted for the nap I took when we got back to the hotel.The place is popular and it was packed when we got there.

The restaurant was mainly empty, just a few diners in the outdoor seating area and us. The hostess was not happy when we asked to be seated inside, but did accommodate us after speaking to a server. We were seated directly across from the bar. When our server approached he asked if it was our first visit to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba. We indicated it was. Usually, that elicits a, ""Great! Do you know how our restaurant works."" Instead, what we got was a sign and ""Do you at least know how tapas works?"" Sorry, but that feels like you think we are stupid and uncultured if we have never been there before. (The fact that we drove over 90 minutes to come to this area of Chicago apparently never entered his mind.) He suggested we order 3-4 small plates per person. We did not take his recommendation and still had too much food.We ordered a half pitcher of the peach sangria for the two adults in our party and a flavored iced tea for the teenager. Given that we were driving home after eating, the shared half pitcher was sufficient. The sangria was good and if we had been staying in the area for longer after, I would easily have gotten the full pitcher. Our selections included a lovely brussel sprout salad, meatballs, fire roasted vegetables, a chicken empanada, a flame broiled salmon, and the mixed olives. The marinated mixed olives consisted of just two types of olives - Nicoise and Kalamata. Our other tapas experiences always included at least three kinds and usually a marinated garlic or onion as well. They were okay, nothing to set them apart. The fire roasted vegetables were delicious but slightly more done than I would have preferred. My teenage daughter, however, loved them. It should be noted they are served in a crock with lots of tomatoes making them rather soupy instead of a fork-ready vegetable. The salmon was simply delicious. We could easily have ordered more of this. The accompanying sauce was delicate and really added to the salmon. Stand out dish! The meatballs were basic meatballs covered with a tangy marinara sauce. I think there were 4-5 small ones in our dish. They were a good value for the money and great for those less-adventurous diners. The empanada was the other stand out dish. The crust was super flaky and the filling was just the right amount of spice and flavor to accentuate the flaky crust. Easily the best empanada I have had, even in six trips to Mexico. Expensive for amounts given."

From the initial greeting and our time at the bar to our table, food and service, Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba offered an unforgettable dining experience. Great atmosphere in the well stocked bar and the dining room. The layout is clustered enough to feel that you're part of a social scene but with enough breathing room to enjoy private conversation with the person across from you.In traditional tapas tradition, the menu is varied and I have to say: EVERYTHING we tried out of this world. Highlights included: Grilled Octopus with Harissa, Chorizo-wrapped dates and the Hangar Steak with charred Green Chili chimichurri. All offered different flavor experiences but tied together so nicely.If you are looking for tapas or just an excellent meal while in Chicago, walk, jog, sprint, bike, hoverboard, Uber or drive yourself to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!"

We were there for lunch on Friday, April 15 and with our 12:30 reservation, we were seated right away. We ordered the full pitcher of sangria (which we probably could have gotten the half pitcher in retrospect, but oh well--vacation), which tasted like true Spanish sangria with brandy and other liquors. Read: not all sugar. We ordered the patatas bravas, which were roasted with a spicy mayo on the side, which, in our opinion, were perfectly seasoned and roasted. We also ordered the chicken and chorizo skewers, which were okay, but the chicken was lacking a bit in seasoning or flavor, so we found ourselves dipping it in sauces from other dishes to get rid of the blandness. We ordered the shrimp, which appeared to be broiled in a small pan with olive oil and red pepper flakes, which was a nice change from the usual fried shrimp dishes at tapas restaurants. When I went to the bathroom, I saw a sign that said if you check in on Facebook, you get a free dessert, so I checked-in and we ordered a chocolate truffle cake, which was a small portion, but so rich and dense, it was the perfect size for us to share. The service was average; nothing to be blown away by or anything, but we have virtually no complaints. We had a fantastic time and would definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting Chicago!"

I feel you don't get to try as much with 2 people or you don't finish what you order so that you can save room for more.

We had reservations for 5:15 and were seated promptly. Our table was in the back of the restaurant wedged between a table of 15 and a very busy isle used by the waiters. In reality there should not have even been a table there as it was cramped, noisy and two of us continually got bumped by the wait staff.That being said, the food at most Lettuce Entertain you restaurants is usually top notch as is the service. The food here was average to poor. Each Tapas we ordered that was fried, was overly greasy and devoid of any flavor. The three meat Tapas we got were very tough and seemed as if they sat out for quite some time.The blood orange sangria was flavorful but did not seem like it contained any alcohol. It was watered down at best. We switched to draught beer for our second round which was much better.The worst part of the dinner was the poor service. Our waiter disappeared for long stretches of time. On two occasions, he forgot one of the items we ordered. Other wait staff then brought the item 3 different times even after we finally received it. When we asked for the bill we explained that we needed to leave as the dinner had taken 2 hours and 15 minutes and our show was starting in 30 minutes. The waiter than disappeared for another 10 minutes with our credit cards.We made the show, but the whole experience was bad.

We were celebrating my son's birthday last Saturday and made reservations online thru Open Table. This restaurant gets SUPER busy, even at 5:30 pm, so be sure you make reservations. Parking is permit only in the neighborhood and there is no garage. CBR does have a valet service for $13. Totally worth it, Lincoln Park is super busy on the weekend and it's very hard to find street parking.We began our evening with cocktails; they offer many flavors of Sangria. I usually order 1/2 a pitcher of red wine Sangrias. You get about 3 full glasses from 1/2 a pitcher. It's more economical than individual glasses. CBR also offers full pitchers. My sons ordered a margarita and a mojito. We discovered that many places offer a mojito but there is an art to actually making a good mojito, CBR fell short on this mojito. Not mixed correctly. Margarita was fine.Tapas is a great way to try several dishes with your companions. Tapas are appetizer sized portions of Spanish dishes and arrive at your table in no special order. We usually start off with 2 per person, keep a menu handy and order more as the night progresses. We've been to CBR a few times and have tried pretty much everything on the menu and have been happy with taste, quality and quantity. If you order the paella, allow some extra time for it's preparation. Our waiter, busboy and servers were very efficient, even thought the restaurant was packed! They never forgot about us and were quick to refill our water glasses, clear dishes and bring new dishes to our table.When making the reservation on Open Table I did note that we would be celebrating my son's 22nd Birthday but, no complimentary dessert was offered to him :(.Note: The noise level does get loud due to the high ceilings, kinda hard to hear your diner companions sometimes."

Most of the dishes were very good. We were a party of 5 and got 2 of each dish to share between us and that was more than plenty. Top notch dishes for me were the Squid, the beef tenderloin with blue cheese and the spicy potatoes. There was also a date and chorizo thing for $2 - can't remember exactly what it was, but that was delicious! The butterscotch dessert was divine and even though the deserts were all tiny they were the perfect size for just a sweet treat after dinner. Low points - the shrimp - very oily and the goats cheese in tomato sauce - didn't see the point of that one. The staff were great, very efficient, there was a steady flow of dishes coming to the table throughout. It was an expensive proposition, but over the Christmas one tends to splurge more, a lot more!

The service continued to be great all night, and our server made excellent recommendations on the menu. I was concerned that the food wouldn't be authentic Spanish tapas because I've been to places before, claiming to be authentic when in fact they are not, but that was not the case here. The food seemed as authentic as if we were actually sitting and enjoying it in Spain. The pitcher of Sangria was enough for three to split and enjoy two or so glasses each, and out favorite dish was the patatas bravas which I recommend. Overall, we had a great experience and highly recommend it!"

I already knew I wanted the bacon wrapped dates (A MUST!!!!!) and I went easy with the ham and cheese croquetas, which ended up having the texture and appearance of cheese sticks, but were tasty especially with the accompanying sauces. The barman recommended the short rib and that was seriously on point. Sangria is poured from a tap, so while not quite having the taste of completely homemade, it is still damn good. I didn't try the paella, but the couple next to me did and it had the look and aroma like the ones I used to have when I lived in Valencia.

Date-glazed bacon side: order it. Pintxos platter: one of us ordered it, but with all the other tapas we ordered, this didn't quite get finished. The platter is enough for one person if other dishes are not ordered or are at a minimum. The spinach/artichoke crepe was sharable; the crepe and perhaps one other tapas would have been enough for one person. If you're order various tapas, order just a single paella, not the platter for 2-3. Very good gazpacho (serves one). The brussel sprout (cold) salad is crunchy, not spicy, kind of bland, but good because it's a nice break from the other spicier tapas. If I went again I would order entirely different items - there was plenty we didn't try. The place was very busy at 1pm on a Saturday, but a few empty tables remained. Lots of tables."

Since they were small, I was able to try about 6 things. There wasn't a clunker in the bunch. All were fantastic. The chorizo wrapped dates, the deviled egg, mushroom toast, meatballs, chicken empanada...all were spectacular. I had wine, which wasn't a happy hour special, but wow did the sangria look good.

We sat at a table near the bar with sangria to start with and looked through a comprehensive menu. The conversation switched into a Spanish consultation with our friends and our helpful and efficient waiter on what to have and what was day's specials. We sat back and let it happen and it was amazing. Beautiful food came out a couple of dishes at a time so that it was always hot and fresh. It was busy with a sociable buzz and all tables filled. We had booked in advance and there was no waiting when we arrived. We were not rushed at all, and service was efficient but not intrusive. Unlike some tapas places we have visited, the dishes are large enough for four to share so you can have a range of dishes and feel like you are actually having something to eat...not just a little nibble of this and that. Mushrooms with spinach, spicy potatoes and some little pulled pork rolls were great, and there were also seafood dishes and cheeses. After sangria starters our friends ordered a California red wine that complimented the food wonderfully well.Don't come if you are in a hurry, and it's best to come with a few people to justify ordering a range of dishes. Four was a good number in terms of portion sizes. A memorable brunch and well worth a visit."

Knowing this is tapas cuisine, we planned on taking our time sampling the different dishes. We ordered the paella first then ordered the other small dishes. The paella came out in about 10 minutes so we felt a bit rushed because we wanted to eat the paella while it was still hot.Aside from that, everything was great. The paella was served table side out of the cast iron skillet. We have the pork paella and it was wonderful.

If you like chocolate - you will love this. The restaurant specializes in many different types of sangria. I had the Peach and the White. The peach was very flavorful but I preferred the white with a softer taste. The group also had pitchers of the black raspberry that I did not try but they said it was fabulous. I'm ready to take my husband there now!"

Once we were seated, we ordered what didn't seem like much but ended up being more than enough. I really wanted some rice but the paella is minimum 2 servings and nobody seem to want any so the waiter suggested to order rice from the kids menu, it was a small portion but it was very yummy. This portion isn't advertised on the main menu, so now you know if you are looking for some rice but not a mountain of it. We ordered skewered chicken and chorizo sausage (good but my least favorite, it was bland compared to the other flavorful dishes), spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms (delicious!), spicy potatoes (we ordered 2 of these, they are very good!), meatballs (also delicious). The surprise of the night for me were yummy roasted dates with bacon and apple vinaigrette. I don't like dates and I thought the mix of ingredients was weird, but a friend of mine loves them (lives in Chicago and visits often) so I tried them and yup, she was correct, they are quite good!!! Must try if you are adventurous :)Service was quite good, our waiter was nice and made suggestions. It's a busy place so reservations is recommended.

In fact I was kind of angry because the food delivery people just fling it on your table without even saying here is your food--I almost knocked off one dish with my elbow because I did not know he was serving the food. And then the food delivery person ""runs"" away from your table, if something is wrong where is your waiter--not to be found. Also, you should not reach across someone to fill up water on your left. Ask if they want water and do not reach across their personal space--basic serving 101. And do not hound us to remove every plate two seconds after we finish--they seem to notice empty plates before empty wine glasses. This place is too good to have such sloppy poorly trained service.

(Even on an out-of-season Monday night). It is loud, so if this is a problem for you, request one of the more quiet rooms--although these will still be quite noisy! I have never sampled anything here that I didn't like. The white peach sangria was nice and ""sturdy"" (another person stated that it was watery--ours was not). Order your paella while you are looking over the other tapas on the menu because it takes about 20-30 minutes to prepare--we had the seafood paella and it was excellent. Unfortunately, we had filled ourselves a little too full on other tapas and had plenty of paella leftover. The waitresses are very helpful in explaining different flavorings, and the menu changes frequently. This is a great place to celebrate an event with a group, or TGIF!"

You can tell a lot about a restaurant by reading the faces of the wait and bus staff. Are they frazzled, slow, tired, hard to find? Here they are genuinely friendly, know the menu, continuously clear away the many plates, and refill water glasses with great speed and efficiency. They work extremely hard serving many hot and cold dishes to each table throughout the course of a meal. The wait and bus staff deserve as much recognition as the kitchen staff. Take your time, keep a menu, and just keep ordering whatever sounds intriguing. Chose a variety, share, and try things you never ate before. Remember, these are small plates and that's half the fun! The pace is timed perfectly by the servers. Special sangrias of the day are offered, but my personal favorite is the classic red, the gold standard. Favorite menu items are bacon wrapped dates, deviled eggs, salmon, meatballs, and octopus, but everything tastes delicious. It can get noisy, so I prefer the small rooms in the back or the sunroom on the left. Request those if you like things more quiet. Enjoy!"

Despite the large number of people you did not feel at all crowded and the seats were quite comfortable. The main beverage is the sangria (5 types, we had both the red and the mango) but there is both a large Spanish wine list and a medium beer list. We had 4 of the desserts. All were good with the butterscotch pudding and the mocha almond bar being excellent.The crowd was heavily female (about 5 to 1) with lots of either bachelorette party or girls-night-out groups.

Apologized again and then left. We did not see him for over ten minutes. The table was empty next to us so I grabbed one of their napkins to wipe up the rest, but I was still without a napkin.

It was one of our favorite places. I, years ago, took a group at a convention to eat there; it was terrific and since I was hosting, I was glad it was also not expensive. Family members had a rehearsal dinner there a few years ago; also great.But that last time we ate there it was terrible. I thought maybe it was an off night and so we headed there again over Thanksgiving week with visiting family. Tapas is a fun way for a group of 7 to dine and everyone was enthusiastic.Alas, disappointed again. Several of the dishes were tasty but as a whole, they tended to be heavily over salted and often overcooked. Just not good. The fried calamari in particular was virtually inedible. It was so covered in an oversalted spice mix that it ended up not even being totally finished by 7 people. There are better Tapas places in Chicago. This one seems to me to coasting on fumes and doesn't live up to my memory of its better days."

The atmosphere of the restaurant and interaction of ordering tapas throughout your meal is great to begin with, and the food is amazing.

Make sure to leave room for dessert though!

My first visit was in April 2011 for my own bachelorette party, organized by my very well-meaning sister-in-law and my best friend. Unfortunately, the dinner part of the evening was planned for quite late at night, and after a long day of activities I ended up not eating, to say the least. So, my review focuses only on my second trip to Cafe Ba Ba Reeba, which was substantially different than my first. I went here for a friend's 30th birthday party, so the menu was pre-determined. Nonetheless, I could not have picked a better selection of tapas to sample: meats (cold cuts and warm selections), cheeses, seafoods, bacon-wrapped figs, potatoes, salads, mini desserts, etc. It was all so GOOD! My husband and I really loved it. I love tapas, but I find that many (if not most) tapas restaurants fall short of knocking me off my feet. Not so with Cafe Ba Ba Reeba. I'm not sure if we were just particularly hungry or what, but my husband and I both left agreeing that it was a fabulous-tasting meal and some of the best tapas we've had. It's hard to pick a favorite dish, but I think my favorite was the diced potatoes with aioli sauce. Sangria was also yummy and fruit-filled.I should also add that it's good for groups. The birthday party we were at was fairly substantial in size and they were able to accomodate us pretty well. I belive it was in the same private room as my bachelorette party, but my memory of that is a little fuzzy :)Go here for delicious tapas when in Chicago! Truly some of the better tapas I've had."

And the padron peppers were flavorful and salty.Add to this a half pitcher of fruity mango sangria and the usual very good crusty bread and a good time was had by both!Better than we remembered from our last trip. Will be back again in the not too distant future."

The fried calamari was okay, as was the beef empanada, but again, both were just....bland. Lots of ""complimentary"" bread and olive oil helped filled the hunger gaps. Not the place for a romantic evening or good conversation, as sound seems to bounce off every surface. Service was provided by a half dozen or so people, with our primary server hovering, as if we needed to hurry up and order instead of taking our time to peruse the menu and enjoy our sangria cocktails. One tapas plate removed before we'd finished what was on it, too noisy to get his attention to get it returned.We really wanted to like this place more than we did, a ""never again"" in our book."

The blackberry was so great my husband ordered a glass for himself instead of another beer. Then the tapas -- th favorite date wrapped in bacon was not to my liking, but the goat cheese croquette was delicious!! The bread spread was good. But the main tapas - we enjoyed the patatas bravas (delicious aioli!), yummy mushroom caps, and a perfectly cooked tenderloin with blue cheese. We were going to skip dessert but our server enticed us with the fact that they were small bites, similar to the tapas. The butterscotch cream was to die for!!! We could eat a vat of that stuff! The apple empanada was also good but was overshadowed by the butterscotch cream. Will definitely come again..."

The fried calamari from the seafood section of the menu was also amazing as was the Spanish ham plate.Just OK: the manchego and spinach stuffed mushrooms, asparagus with manchego cheese, rioja-braised short ribs (ribs were very tender, sauce was bland, mashed potatoes tasted like they were from a package), meatballs with tomato sherry sauce, chicken and ham croquetas (way too much cheese, not enough ham, looked like a mozzarella stick).Our waitress was very nice and helpful.

It was a great choice and the fact that the restaurant is still in business, and BUSY, 10 years later is indicative of what a great choice it is. With tax, pre-tip, the bill was $215 for 5.

When we arrived, we were told that it would be about 5 additional minutes before our name would be called and we would be seated. We were not seated until after 8PM. The host stand was announcing parties to be seated overt their PA system. The odd thing was that there were many more parties being seated without being called. (Friends of the staff perhaps?) At 8, I returned to the host stand to enquire as to what the delay was. Within minutes later, our party was called.About 10 minutes after we were seated, a manager arrived at our table to apologize for the delay in seating. While that was a nice small gesture, a nicer thing would have have been to comp one of our small plates or something to that extent. Given the volume of business, I am not suprised that service recovery is not practiced in this establishment, as there was no shortage of sales...so why bother?

I said something to the waitress about too much food and she said she would help us judge. She did a great job, recommending selections and how much paella to order for our group. I think the consensus of our group was that the grilled scallops and the grilled calamari were our favorites, but everything was wonderful. I described the dinner as one new flavor sensation after another. Prices were very reasonable, service was excellent and the food was scrumptious.

The food itself was also delicious. The patatas bravas with the tomato aioli dipping sauce are a can't miss. We liked them so much we tried to recreate the recipe at home.They do get very busy though, so I would recommend a reservation, especially on the weekend.

The hostess made a point of saying immediate seating was available, even though we hadn't asked about a wait. Clearly, they were already in a ""busy night"" mindset. It wasn't long before the place was packed, and people were waiting in the entry corridor.The good:Everything was perfectly prepared. The jamon iberica, though eye-poppingly expensive, was exquisite. The shrimp, cheese plate, albondigas, patatas bravas, all magnificent. The sangria was an absolute delight. The service was warm and friendly. The busing staff was prompt and attentive about removing used plates from our table. In a tapas restaurant, that's important. The noise level in this busy restaurant was acceptable, at least where we sat.The bad:(1) Parking. It's on the street, and a very busy street at that. We got lucky. Someone was pulling out as we arrived, and we were able to avoid the pricey parking meters. (2) The place is a bit cramped. I was very conscious of foot traffic around me. It appears they've undergone at least a couple of expansions over the years, but they're due for another. (3) I don't know what happened, but one of our orders was delayed mightily. We were finished with everything else before the waiter noticed that it had not arrived. It didn't ruin our night (or the waiter's gratuity), but I was a bit surprised that we weren't offered some sort of goodwill make-good gesture at such a reputable establishment.If you enjoy tapas restaurants, this is a great spot with great food. It just needs a bit more elbow room."

I recently dropped in to get some gift certificates with my little son and decided to have a snack. First, I want to say that we went really early, before 5, so the place was really empty except a few tables here and there and the place is really big with multiple rooms. So what do they do? Sit me right next to a large loud party of 10 or so, right next to the bus boy station with clanking ice and forks dropping. I was like, ""oh please, this place is empty, why are you placing me here? cmon""...and they immediatley moved me to an acceptable spot but how annoying. I would love to hear why they thought that was a good idea. Anyway, then I order a ""trio"" of dips...it would be perfect for my son to dip. He likes that. So three jars on a plate came with toast. It was pretty evident this was bought from European Imports. They opened the three jars, put them on a plate, toasted some bread, and brought it out. I even told the waiter what it was and he denied it but it was pretty obvious. Then I ordered lamb skewers which were good but a small portion for $11. Then I ordered octopus with potatoes which was also good, but more potatoes than Octopus. Anyway, there are many tapas places in the city, and I would certainly choose another one over this place going forward."

The other night a group of ten of us got together to celebrate successfully completing marathons; while OK eight of us completed marathons - one in the group had a good excuse (she was eight and three quarter months pregnant) and one not so good (I am too lazy to train for a marathon, so settled for a half). Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba features a vast array of tapas and breaks them into categories including pintxos (bite sized tapas, kind of like a Spanish amuse bouche but harder to pronounce), vegetarian/cheese, seafood, beef/lamb, and chicken/pork. There are also a few nice paellas to choose from and housemade breads with dips (there is also complimentary basic bread service with olive oil) and of course desserts (there are full sized desserts of dessert pintxos). Sangria is quite popular here (available by the pitcher, half pitcher or glass and in traditional or flavored - there is even a Cava based Sangria); for those not fans of Sangria there is a decent list of reasonably priced Spanish wines (running as low as $28 per bottle and many selections under $50) as well as beer (including some on tap) and cocktails. Adding value there are often freebies you can redeem if you check in via Foursquare or Yelp.As we are distance runners, we tend to have hearty appetites and this enabled us to order a huge variety of tapas (we must have consumed nearly half the menu)! Nearly everything we tried was good, but I would not say there was a single must have dish and the menu did not seem to have changed much since I was last here a couple of years ago. Since my fine dining kick I have been on for the past year and a half I am always nervous returning to venues I used to love before becoming spoiled by Chicago's top tier restaurants, but Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba did not disappoint. For $40 a person (including tax, tip and moderate alcohol) we were able to eat like kings. Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba is open nightly for dinner and also has Friday lunch and weekend brunch. They post special events on their website such as a Flamenco Dinner Show with music and dancing and Paella Cooking Demos. The atmosphere is lively and casual and the decor is made to transport you to Spain without being tacky or overdone. Service is reasonably attentive and adequate. Ba-Ba-Reeba is a popular venue so it can be a bit noisy and reservations are recommended (they are on Open Table). There is a large bar where you can enjoy a glass of Sangria as you wait for your party to arrive, but I did appreciate that they sat us before our entire party arrived. The menu has a nice variety of food to choose from (even the vegetarians in our group found plenty to keep them happy) and while the food is certainly not outstanding, for the money it is a good choice if you are in the mood for Spanish tapas."

Our server, Daniel, was very knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the menu and specials. He recommended 2-3 tapas per person. We ordered 6 total and it was perfect! The tapas portion (not sure if they always offer this or if it was just because it was the Paella festival) of the paella was awesome and the perfect size. The patatas bravas were also really great.

The tapas plates were enough for each of us to have a couple bites of each offering and are brought to the table as the kitchen gets them ready, so if you stagger your order you can have a steady stream, of food. We started by each picking one plate then took turns adding others one at a time as we went. Our favorite was the beef tenderloin & blue cheese - tender and tasty. Our second favorite was the citrus-cured salmon, cucumber, crema & toast. Other choices that were all good were the following: roast dates with bacon & apple vinaigrette, grilled chicken skewer with zucchini almond pesto, warm potato & onion omelette (generoud serving), and grilled squid with olive oil & garlic.

If you're looking for good tapas and in the Chicago area, don't miss this wonderful restaurant. The atmosphere is active and festive. The service is good. The food is great!The last time I went here, I think they had expanded as it looked quite a bit larger, but still had the same feel to it. Although it's always been a popular place to go in Lincoln Park, I think it's grown tremendously. I went very early - I think it was around 5pm, and the place was packed! My recommendation is to get there early.If you're with a larger group, get the paella and sangria, then order some tapas. I personally like to skip the paella and sangria (both are excellent) and go right for a varierty of hot and cold tapas (this is the real reason I go). I have never had a bad tapas dish there ever! I have yet to try them all, but I've tried almost half of them and they are all excellent. By the time you get done sampling all of the little tapas dishes, the cost can quickly add up, especially if you have an appetite. It's well worth the price, but just be aware of this.This restaurant is highly recommended and one of my all-time favorites in Chicago. Go - you won't be disappointed."

We were seated on the patio under the awning when the heavens opened up. After about five minutes, the drainage system on the awning gave away at the far end and some water came cascading in. Where we were seated a few drips came down so we moved our table away from the wall about six inches. The waiter asked if we wished to be moved inside, we said no as it was not that bad at all. When our bill arrived we were pleasantly surprised that the management had made a generous adjustment for our ""inconvenience"" due to the rain issue.

To keep it short and to the point: food was HORRIBLE, sangrias were WATERY (2 pitchers and not even a buzz and we aren't big drinkers), items OVERPRICED. I've lived in NYC and Washington, DC so used to paying high $$ for great food and honesty don't mind if it's mind blowing, but this stuff was mediocre at best. Just don't waste your time and money here. I'm baffled at the great reviews of this place. There are certainly much better places to eat in Chicago. Do yourself a favor and SKIP IT."

There was a wonderful array of choices, including stuffed mushrooms, calamari, spicy meatball, and ahi tuna. After choosing our favorites from the menu, we waited, not long for our first small plates to be brought out. As we passed around the plates, and tasted a little bit of everything we were very satisfied with the food. It was flavorful and delicious. As we continued with the tapas ordering, the meat with cheese on top, and some wrapped dates with cheese, we all had our favorites. And then, the paella came out! Wow! The rice dish was spectacular! Following was dessert, which did not fail to impress. I would recommend this restaurant to diners who like to try a little of everything.

If you like the concept of tapas, this is a great choice in Chicago.The restaurant is located in the Lincoln Park neighborhood of Chicago. There is valet parking but the restaurant can be accessed by a three block walk from the Armitage station on the EL brown line. There are lots of restaurants in this area but this place obviously holds its own by the crowd that had gathered here on the Friday night we were there. This restaurant takes reservations and you probably want to make one if you are going on a Friday or Saturday night. The restaurant has a farily good size dining area and also an outdoor area if the weather is nice. There is a private dining area as well, which was reserved the night we were there. As for the tapas, we loved any of the croquette dishes. These were breaded balls of goodness (similar to a fritter). While we were there they had a rice and mushroom croquette and a ham and cheese croquette. I also really liked the pork shank, the goat cheese with tomato sauce and bread, and of course the chocolate truffle dessert. All of our dishes we chose, however, were all good.

She explained the menus, service, and was very detailed. Within minutes, we booked the party and my panic was gone. Service was excellent- we had our own room in a very busy, crowded, lively restaurant! We had our own staff- friendly and prompt- they anticipated our every need, and worked around a few late-comers. Needless to say the food was delicious, and all of Alison's recommendations were right on target- we added toros to one of their packages.

We told the waiter we had never been to a tapas restaurant before, and he seemed to relish the opportunity to tell us how to order, what portion sizes to expect, etc. We, too, like a previous poster ordered the bacon wrapped dates, and they were so great. The date was so moist I was convinced that it had been soaked in something, but the server said it hadn't. The two flavors don't sound especially complementary, but the differences in textures is quite nice. We also ordered a three cheese dish that was good, a really tasty scallop dish, and a very flavorful chicken kabob. We ended with a mango sorbet that had such an deliciously intense taste that the shot-sized glass it was served in was just the right size.Our waiter couldn't have been nicer or more helpful, and when he presented the check, he said that the sorbet would be on the house!We ate at quite a few great places on our trip, but this was our favorite!"

As advertised, it is ""like nothing you've ever seen before."" Located at 1021 West Armitage Avenue in the Lincoln Park neighborhood, Butcher and the Burger goes a long way in answering the often asked question: ""Which restaurant serves the best hamburgers in Chicago?"" Burgers are the priority here. But patrons also can enjoy shrimp, fresh salmon, cube steaks, home-made potato chips and frozen custard. And they can take home ground patties, meatballs, house-made meatloaf and marinara sauce. That aside, the primary issue for debate is which burger do you prefer? Grass-fed prime beef burger or sirloin steak burger or House blend prime beef burger? And which toppings? And which bun? Well, I chose the House blend prime beef burger on a whole wheat bun with lettuce, tomato, raw onion, ketchup, yellow mustard, American cheese and Benton's Tennessee Mountain smoked bacon. With potato salad and potato chips. My wife opted for a sirloin steak burger on a croissant with BBQ sauce. We washed it all down with root beer and a chocolate shake, then treated ourselves to chocolate frozen custard for dessert. If that wasn't enough, we took home some meatballs and marinara. Butcher and the Burger is open from 11 to 9 Sunday through Wednesday, 11 to 8:30 on Thursday and 11 to 10 on Friday and Saturday. I wonder if Allen Sternweiler has any other ideas in his chef's hat."

Maybe it was my hunger and the fact I'd been walking around all morning, but after that first bite of burger I was blown away.The burger is the choose your own adventure variety. Pick the protein type, the rub, the cheese, the bun, and all the toppings. The standard ones are free, but the ""premium"" toppings will add a bit extra. I chose the regular beef burger with the ghost pepper blend and all standard toppings (no premium) and with a MexiCoke the total was under $15. Seems a bit pricey, but not that different from other premium type of burgers. The ghost rub was the perfect amount of kick for me. I didn't think it was ""spicy"" though I have a high tolerance, but it was just enough to add a bit of oompf to the burger. The burger was cooked perfectly to my liking (mid-rare) and they have the charred taste and feel of backyard burgers right off the grill. So no, you're not getting one of those pretentious burgers per se, but a real down to Earth burger. I was disappointed I didn't try the fries, but I definitely am looking forward to going back again. Now I have an excuse to try the fries and perhaps add some accoutrement off the premium toppings. The place is kinda small. There aren't a whole lot of tables, but there is a long counter with stools. I came in on Friday at/around 13:00 and it was busy, though two large groups seemed to enter literally right before me.

So it must've been a good burger. The place is a small, hipster neighborhood burger bar. It's BYOB, burgers can be pricy but I was on vacation so I didn't really care, and it was the first time I've ever seen a burger place have so many options for different combinations of burgers. You choose your bun, your seasonings, your toppings, sauces, etc. They have many options for burger patties too including black bean, fish, turkey and grass-fed beef (which is amazing). It's messy (as a burger should be), delicious, and my incredibly healthy low-calorie diet friend saw my fries and couldn't help but order some.

If you get overwhelmed by the extensive options (like my gf) they have a curated list of favorites that you can select from as well. She got a turkey burger that was prebuilt, I had a bite and was very impressed at how well seasoned it was. I built my own with the house blend, desert chili seasoning, a pretzel bun, and grilled onions and it was fantastic! The meat had a slight char (ordered medium) and was really juicy. All of this was served on small cutting boards branded with the store's name and logo.Overall, great food, good atmosphere, in a good neighborhood. Two burgers with tap water came out to $26.

This is a tiny burger spot with very few places to sit and only about 5 tables. You order at a counter then struggle and fight for a place to sit and eat. It was $50 for two people! We had 2 burgers,fries, 2 sodas and a shake. It all tasted good but not any better than hundreds of other burger spots in Chicago. I felt robbed. The burgers aren't even that big either. We've paid way less for far better at many other places. HUGE disappointment. The tables are very uncomfortable and crowded so close it was awkward."

My mom intially didn't want any because she didn't know what is was, but after trying mine loved it. It was really sweet compared to the coke I normally have.

The shop has a number of different spices that you can have on your burger -- I had an onion-soup-blend spice mix! The burgers are cooked to order and the outside had a nice crunch to it. The burgers, though, are a little overpriced for their size. The burger was not even a half pound of meat, so I downed it in four bites.The fries were average. The cashier said that the small was more than enough for two people but I easily finished it on my own (although I have a large appetite). The fries came with no type of house sauce (from what I recall, the shop has an aioli dip but it costs extra).The custard shake was excellent. The custard was the right consistency and the flavor -- buttermilk -- was rich throughout. It was as if I were drinking liquid butterscotch candies!The beignets are the main reason I gave a 4 rather than a 3. The beignets were just like those that I would have in New Orleans.

Let's start with a few quirks, the place is small, with limited seating and the service is good, not great. These minor details are easily obliterated by how well they do what they do. The menu is mainly burgers and they do them extraordinarily well. You start by choosing your meat, then the seasonings, then toppings. Let's be clear here, although there are choices and some of them are interesting, you're not going to find any contrived mango and peach salsa burgers or other chic, stylish stuff, but you will find things that are interesting and really make sense on a burger like bacon, a fried egg, even seared foie gras.You also need to chose your condiments and type of bun. Although the focus is on the burger, I shared an order of fries with the person I dined with and I have to say, they knocked it out of the park on those too. They were hand cut, real potatoes, but not done in that, floppy, greasy style. These were thick cut, tender and crispy on the outside, with just enough salt to accent the taste.The burger was cooked to perfection for me (medium well, medium rare for my friend). It was juicy enough to drip, but not greasy. I generally tend to use a knife and fork for dining in most situations, but this called for me to dive in and get my hands dirty :)I chose the beef burger, with ""grandma's onion soup"" seasoning, and blue cheese. The burger was seared crisp on the outside, perfectly tender and yielding on the inside and the flavor was excellent. The prices were reasonable and the food was served pretty quickly. The restaurant is in a nice neighborhood, and not far from the ""L"", easy to find and get to. Definitely recommended, one the best meals in recent memory and definitely the best burger in a decade for me. You will not regret a trip there.

I visited around 8:00 on a Friday night, and even though it was a pretty small dining room, we were lucky enough to find a place to sit. I ordered a turkey burger with swiss and avocado. I wish I had been a little hungrier, because it was delicious but I wasn't able to finish it. If I hadn't ordered fries, it would have been no problem. The fries were excellent, though. We weren't able to stay for any length of time after eating, as there were people waiting for tables. That would be the only minor gripe, but it really wasn't a big deal. I would return.

TRUST ME... just go with the standard house blend (there are other exotic options). While there are plenty of bun and toppings options, which are individual preference, I will say the Chicago Steakhouse blend is fantastic!! The place is small and can get busy, but it's nice atmosphere. Two people can split a french fry. The burger is served to you on a small wooden cutting board, and the burger is fantastic!

The atmosphere is great and the two burgers and fries were great as well. I got a regular Grass Fed Burger with Cheddar Cheese and my wife got a kid's size of the same. We shared a large fry and it was the perfect amount of food. Neither of us felt too full to get out and walk. It was great being able to sit at butcher blocks for tables and the food being brought on miniature butcher blocks. There isn't much seating so be sure you are okay with waiting for a table to open up. For us it was timed perfectly by the time our food was prepared and brought to us. I think we waited for a table for about 10-15 minutes before we got a table and then the food was to us after 2 or 3 minutes more. Everything is made to order so don't expect to be in and out like a fast food restaurant. The closest chain I can compare it to is a very small Five Guys but the food is much better and has a neighborhood dive feel to it. I will come back here every time I'm in Chicago. It's worth 25 minutes of walking and train riding to get there.

There they could jazz it up with more sauce options for the fries, but they are good enough to eat without anything on them.I like the environmentally friendly vibe too. The burgers are served on cutting boards and with real knives so no waste there. And they let you drink water without drama!

I was just telling friends that unless we want to spend more than we are comfortable spending on a mid-week dinner, there are not that many places to eat in our neighborhood. I almost hate to write this review because the place is small and and you’re going to keep going back once you try it, crowding me out during my many return trips. After seeing a ""best burger"" review in Time Out, my husband and I checked out this smallish, BYOB, corner-restaurant for dinner. I'm not a burger fan. He is and has endured, but politely has not returned to, any place I have selected in the past. Half-way through his burger he announced we should come back. He through the meat, the bun, and the hand-cut fries were all delicious.It gets better. Currently on their menu is an incredible shrimp cake that is the equivalent to a true east coast crab cake. By that I mean large lumps of fish, no filling other than some egg white magically suspending the lumps that are spiced in a heavenly manner that includes a wasabi spread. Delicious! I have given up ordering crab cakes in Chicago. Even though they say they are lump, they are not as good as the east coast and full of unappealing breading and shreds of fish. The price for The Butcher’s shrimp delight is about $13 but, as cheap as I am, so well worth it. I wanted to go back and have it for breakfast the next day. My one minor disappointment is their beignets. I was indoctrinated by the short-lived beignet shop at Lincoln and Webster a few years ago and liked those better. However, the butcher’s are fine. We took them home and they were gone before bedtime. This shop also sells meat items, including meatloaf, to go. Take time to read their extensive offerings including cooking classes. I’m not doing justice to all the extras this excellent restaurant offers. I fave ""very good"" for service becasue this is a go-up and order place. They deliver the food. Friendly staff and hands-on owner/chef, this casual place is top-drawer."

Chez Moi proved to be a unique take.During our annual trip to Chicago, we took our good friend to Chez Moi. We began with their escargot. This was sauteed with minced onion and herbs in a flaky puff pastry cap. Tasty, but very different. The boys had the traditional French onion soup---they enjoyed it but stated it wasn't the best they've ever had. For entrees we had their ""duck al' orange"" , the spinach-stuffed porkloin, and the salmon. By far the duck was the best of the three---tender with an understated orange sauce. For dessert, we had their creme brulee---again in my opinion, a unique interpretation---heavier,creamier with a crunchy caramel glaze.The venues and service are, by far, the real stars of the show. The interior is lovely and cozy and the outdoor venue, where we decided to eat, was just as lovely. Service was spot-on and every member of the staff was warm and welcoming---from host to bus staff to wait staff---perfection!While Chez Moi isn't our absolute favorite French restaurant, it is definitely worth a trip in every aspect. Do go expecting a ""unique experience""."

We anticipated our return this time, but were very disappointed. First, the website advertised still half-price wine on Mondays, but it was no longer available. The web also showed a menu that was out of date and a wine list that had no relation to the list at the table. The night was crowded, as it was the first day of restaurant week. My wife asked if the scallops au gratin could be prepared without the cheese, and after consulting with the kitchen, said they could. I ordered the pork tenderloin stuffed with spinach and goat cheese. When our meals were delivered, my wife's scallops were floating in cheese sauce. They took her meal back to redo and we waited for it to return. It was delivered again floating in cheese, and our server had the nerve to argue that it was not. All this time, my meal was left to cool. I asked for the manager, who took the scallops back again, along with my meal. We were comped a round of wine. About 25 minutes after our original meals were delivered, we received our meals again. My wife's scallops were done nicely, no cheese, but my pork tenderloin had maybe two tablespoons of ""stuffing"", quite eatable but nothing remarkable. Overall, it was a negative experience and between the service and the attitude, we will not be back."

Everything was excellent but I focus on the cassoulet which exceeded most that I have had in Toulouse ... the sauce was a lighter olive oil and tomato, rather than heavier creamy gravy, and the meat (duck, sausage, lamb) was excellent quality in reasonable proportions.

However, it turned out to be one of the worst dining experiences we’ve ever had. It started when we arrived and the hostess only had one menu for 4 of us to share. She promised to return with more but never did. We were taken to a table in the back of the restaurant. (it's divided in 2 with the kitchen in the middle.). Perhaps it was because of the hot weather that day but that back room was unusually warm and stuffy. The smells from the nearby kitchen made it even worse. The menu problem was a harbinger of things to come as the service was dismal at best for the rest of the evening. We had to flag someone down every time we wanted anything….including the opportunity to order. Our reservation was at 7pm and we finally left at 9:45 but not because we enjoyed lingering over our meal but because it took forever to get anything including the check. Plates weren’t cleared, water glasses not filled, drink orders not taken. Then we sat with dessert menus for 20 minutes and no one ever returned to take a desert order. To make matters worse, no one at the restaurant ever acknowledged that there were on-going delays and sloppy service. By the way, the food ok but it was hard to enjoy.There are many good even great restaurants in Chicago. This is not one of them."

Sadly, it did not live up to its reputation. First, we ate outside because it was a lovely evening and inside was dark and gloomy and empty; everyone else was sitting outside so we joined them. But the tables were very close together, wobbly and very uncomfortable (one person had to sit on a long bench that had a planter on the back top--which meant that the back part of the bench kept digging into his neck and back). Then there was the food. I ordered one of the daily specials--duck in a peach sauce, supposedly a Julia Child recipe but Julia would never use canned peaches! What's more, the duck was overdone, stringy and tough. We didn't risk dessert. The bread was good though!"

The hosts had reserved this bistro for several hours. The attentive staff poured never-ending mimosas throughout the affair and also attended to a variety of other beverage needs including non-stop coffee. The preset menu was served family style. The platters were filled to the brim. The first course was Salade Maison Chez Moi. This delightful starter had a tad too much dressing. The homemade bread baskets needed to be replenished at most tables.The main course included three entrees that were served in succession. Truites Beurre Blanc, Quiche Provencale, and Crepes Printemps. Despite the size of the crowd, all the platters were served piping hot. While I'm accustomed to eating a diet that has less butter, cheese, and cream, all the entrees were tasty and complimented one another.The finishing touch was Les Patisseries Chez Moi. These bite sized samples added to the caloric overload. After nibbling on a couple, I had totally maxed out on my saturated fat intact for the entire week, but was happy that I had indulged.Celebrations are meant for splurging. There's no doubt that Chez Moi can successful cater to a small crowd eager to be wined and dined."

Chez Moi offers a typical ambiance that is both welcoming and comfortable. Colorful walls with dark wood accents frame large paintings. The long, narrow room starts with a bar on one side and tables filling the rest of the space. Michael, our server, was prompt, efficient and very helpful. His friendly demeanor was a real plus to the evening.Classic cocktails were a bit pricey but generous and made with top shelf spirits. Craft beers and a good range of French wines appropriate for the menu are available. Buying a bottle generally is a better choice than by the glass. The menu is typical if a bit unimaginative. Bread for the table was excellent. Our mussels arrived in a quaint kettle with a generous mound of really good fries. The charcuterie plate was good but the sausage was missing. Entrees were well-portioned but had a few issues. A rack of pork was a bit under-cooked but it was corrected immediately. The Idaho Lake Rainbow Trout, though good, bore little resemblance to the description on the menu. Desserts were very good including a Brittany Cake and a superb Apple Tart.Chez Moi is a case of the whole being greater than the sum of its parts. Nothing was bad and everything was good to very good. The room and staff were inviting and our dinner was enjoyable. Yes, there are some better or more authentic bistros in Chicago but we had a very nice evening. And, isn’t that what It’s all about? "

The rustic wooden floor and simple light fixtures add to the simplicity.Service was pleasant and attentive. When asked, our waiter advised that the salad would be large enough to share. Like the restaurant itself, the salad was simple but served with a well seasoned, light vinaigrette. The bread was hearty with a very crunchy crust and perfect for sopping up gravy. The house merlot was fragrant, and perfectly accompanied both the lobster ravioli with seared scallops over creamy polenta and the lamb shank with grilled veggies and cous cous bathed in a rich broth.

Located at 2100 North Halsted Street in the heart of Lincoln Park, it is a unique French bistro that was created by chef Dominique Tougne, who was chef de cuisine at Chicago's Bistro 110 from 1996 to 2011, with the help of former Chicago Blackhawks player Cristobal Huet. Translated, Chez Moi means my place/home. The restaurant is intimate and comfortable, the service is warm and friendly and the food is feasty and delicious. Crystal chandeliers serve as a twinkling Parisian sky. Candles are street lamps and an oversized clock looks like it came from the Giant of Casteinau's wristwatch. Many of Tougne's recipes come from his grandmother's restaurant in Bordeaux, such as the beurre blanc sauce of his wild mushroom ravioli and the spices of his cassoulet, a slow-cooked meat casserole that originated in the South of France. Or how about his gateau breton salidou, described as ""the biggest and best shortbread cookie on the planet"" by one food critic. The menu is so appetizing and unique that you want to bring four or six people to the table and order different items, then critique them all. For example, which appetizers do you prefer--mussels or escargots or Charcuterie plate or bacon and onion tart or Boudin aux Pommes or Quail in a Pot or sauteed foie gras? Soups and salads? As you might expect, the French Onion soup is one-of-a-kind. So is Green Beans Perigord. Entrees? You can't go wrong with Beef Tenderloin en Croute or Braised Lamb Shank Tagine or Salmon Filet or Lobster Ravioli and Maine Scallops Duo or Idaho Lake Rainbow Trout or Canard (Duck) a l'Orange or Chez Moi's Burger (beef, braised short ribs) or Wild Mushroom Ravioli or Steak Frites au Poivre. Something for everybody. And save room for dessert, either Gateau Breton Salidou (Brittany cake with salty caramel sauce and Fomage Blanc ice cream) or Profiteroles (my wife's favorite, which you don't find on many menus) or home-made apple tart or Vacherin Fruits de la Passion (Vacherin Passion fruit sorbet, fresh raspberries, mini meringue) or dark chocolate mousse. It's so good that you might forget that you have a pair of theater tickets in your pocket."

He makes a point of visiting with his guests as they dine, sharing wonderful stories of his childhood in France.

We were there in-time to take advantage of their Early Bird prix fixe menu which is a tremendous value. We started with the Soup du Jour (cream of asparagus) and the Green lentil salad. Both were excellent. Although their cassoulet has chicken instead of the traditional duck, it has a rich flavor that includes rosemary and mixes well with white beans. It is also a very filling dish. The Idaho trout with sorrel and quinoa offers complementary flavors that enhance the fish. Also as expected, Chez Moi serves an excellent complimentary French bread that's crusty on the outside but chewy on the inside. For dessert we would recommend the Gateau Breton Salidou which is a dense butter cake topped with a scoop of not too sweet ice cream in a caramel sauce. You can control the overall sweetness by how much caramel sauce you use. We have found that the wines by the glass are very pricey. The Staff was very friendly and attentive.

The reviews were good, so we went there with high hopes, and we were not disappointed!First of all, Chez Moi has a very attractive menu, with a $29.00 prix fixe menu offered from 5:00 PM to 6:30 PM. All the starred items can be had on the prix fixe menu. For a starter, I ordered the Soupe Gratinée à l'oignon, for my main dish the Poulet Rôti with mashed potatoes, and for dessert I had la crème brulée. My husband had a green salad with roasted pumkin seeds, garlic croutons, and tomatoes. For his main dish, he ordered the Cassoulet, and for dessert, he had Gâteau Breton Salidou -- Breton cake with ice cream. My crème brulée was wonderful, but the Breton cake was amazing! I asked our very friendly waiter, Mike, which of two Rose wines was better, and he replied without hesitation that the Château Haut-Sarthes, Bergerac was the better wine, and he was right! I'm now looking for a bottle. I also asked him about the bread. It was so good that I thought maybe it had come from La Fournette, and he told me that it did! The chef is wonderful, the food was perfectly prepared, and the staff was very efficient, as well as friendly. The chef, from the Alsace region of France, came out and chatted with all the diners.

I wish it were always on their menu - I'd be back every week! It was truly one of the best dishes I've had in quite a while. The broth was irresistibly delicious (I did dip my bread in it), and all of the seafood was cooked to perfection. I couldn't get enough! My husband also said his cassoulet was delicious and finished the plate. I tried it but still think my dish blew the cassoulet out of the water. We finished with the bread pudding. We are both big fans of bread pudding, and this was one of the best I've tried. It was moist, flavorful, and had a delicious caramel sauce.To drink, I tried the French 75 (recommended) and they had an excellent wine special ($35 bottle) which was delicious and very reasonably priced.

I had the rack of lamb, it was fine, cooked properly but there were only four tiny pieces that were literally one bite each, the ratatouille was excellent, but the eggplant that came with it was awful, but luckily my hubby finished it. He had one of the steaks and it was the worst steak I've had. The cut was cheap and so tough his jaw hurt after only eating half. I tried a few bites and was thoroughly disappointed as well. We tried to recover the meal with the Brittany cake which our server recommended, it was so hard and stale we couldn't finish it. The worst cake we've ever ate. We were so disappointed.

The steak I selected was quite tough and when I mentioned this to the waitress, she took it away and brought me another immediately and was very nice about it. Unfortunately, the replacement was just as tough. I think it was more about the cut of meat than the preparation. Neither filet nor New York cuts are available.

The ambiance is exceptional and the service is great but we were disappointed in the quality of the ingredients and the lack of imagination in the dishes we ordered.

We were greeted at the door by the owner and chef. Valet parking is available, but we easily had found street parking a short walk away. We started with the roasted garlic spread which comes with fries. (the fries are not noted on the menu.). I would never have guessed that fries would be fabulous dipped in garlic! Better than bread as we discovered. One criticism is that there are too few fries for the garlic, especially if the group avoids double dipping. I had the foie appetizer, the foie was melt in your mouth delicious, and the appetizer ( described as with oyster mushrooms in a pot wine sauce) comes loaded with asparagus, potatoes and a few other things. While I don't thing they are necessary for the foie, they elevated the appetizer to something a bit hardier. Others in our party enjoyed a beautifully prepared salad and onion soup. All plates returned to the kitchen empty!I had the mussel appetizer as a main course. Next time I would probably ask that it be up sized to a larger portion, not because I really needed more but because it was sooooo good. I like mussels, these were among the best I have had. I briefly debated drinking the remaining juices as a soup, I settled for lots of dipping of the bread into the bowl. Delicious!My husband was equally happy with the mushroom ravioli (I tasted it, very yummy) and our friend volunteered to return the following night for a repeat of the chicken dish. I ended with raspberry sorbet, good but too much. My husband loved his fruit soup!The service was great. Knowledgable and attentive without being overbearing. We will definitely be back."

Our server was both inept in his knowledge of the menu and accompanying wines and he also was no where to be found on several occassions while we waited for our drinks as they sat at the bar. The food was very forgettable and although the chef looked straight out of central casting he should have spent more time in the kitchen as we had dishes not properly prepared. The steak was very chewy and the pot pie was burned around the edges. When the bill arrived we had spent nearly $400 and we're all very disappointed as well as disgusted by the lack of value.

Homeslice Wheel House,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g35805-d4078052-Reviews-Homeslice_Wheel_House-Chicago_Illinois.html,"March 27, 2016",5,Whoever heard of Oregon-style pizza?,"I'm a traditionalist when it comes to pizza. Give me a Chicago-style pizza, thin crust with sausage and cheese, every time. No deep dish or pan or stuffed. No New York-style. So you can imagine my reaction when a friend recommended that I try the Oregon-style pizza at Homeslice Wheel House, which opened in 2013 at 938 West Webster in Lincoln Park. Whoever heard of Oregon-style pizza? Well, give it a try. Two Oregon transplants, Josh Iachelli and Clay Hamilton, got together a few years ago and came up with the idea that their Oregon-style pizza, with a thinner base and a fluffy outer crust, could be a success in Chicago. It definitely isn't Chicago-style pizza. But it's better than New York-style. The menu is as unique as the interior of the restaurant, which is outfitted like a log cabin. The 120-seat room features tree-trunk tables and TVs. You feel like a logger from the Northwest. Start with chips and home-made salsa or meatballs or mozzarella bread sticks or oven-roasted garlic bread. Or you might prefer a Caesar salad or mixed greens or Buffalo bleu chicken or Sesame Soy or raspberry vinaigrette. Or sample the Hungarian mushroom soup or the Yucatan lime with chicken soup. The main event, of course, is pizza, all 36 varieties, hand-tossed, chicken or meat or meat-free, 10 inches or 14 inches or 18 inches. Or you can build your own pie--sauce and base cheese and add meat--or purchase a piece by the slice. I prefer the Boyler Room (pepperoni, mozzarella, provolone and marinara), Benny-B (Italian sausage, green peppers, black olives, mozzarella, provolone and marinara) and Bennett's Beauty (pepperoni, Italian sausage, mushrooms, mozzarella, provolone and marinara). Calzones also are included on the menu. I recommend turkey. There are thousands of pizza parlors in the Chicago area but Homeslice, with its Oregon-style pizza and menu filled with unique items, is a restaurant apart from the rest."

We ordered the breadsticks with goat cheese dipping sauce. The dipping sauce was fantastic, rich, creamy tomatoey. We also had a pepperoni pizza. Every inch of the pizza was covered with delicious pepperoni. The pizza however was a bit greasy and too saucy. Next time I order with light sauce.

The interior design is log cabin, lots of TVs tuned to sports, many large tables and noisy even on a Tuesday night. We chose to sit in the back patio which was very pleasantly designed and much less noisy except for the frequent EL trains whizzing by over head. We were told the name of our server but she did not take our orders or deliver our food or drinks, She came by late in the meal to ask if we needed anything and later to give the bill-not sure who got the tip. The food: started with bread sticks with the feta/marinara dip-very good. The pizza we ordered was topped with Canadian bacon and pineapple.. The crust was OK, the bacon was very large slices and pineapple tidbits were cold, as if thrown on after cooking. All in all it would have tasted better if the toppings were under the cheese, cut smaller and hot."
Homeslice Wheel House,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g35805-d4078052-Reviews-Homeslice_Wheel_House-Chicago_Illinois.html,"September 2, 2015",4,"Really cool place, great pizza - Don't order delivery","I love going to Homeslice. It's a really cool atmosphere - like a party log cabin? If you're there to watch a game, there's plenty of seating to do that; if you're there to chill at the bar, it's a cool bar with a decent amount of space to hang out around; if you're there to get lost in some delish pizza and great vibes, that's there too. I've eaten at Homeslice three times - somehow I've managed never to be seated in the patio (once was during winter, but the other two times I sat inside once, and out front along the sidewalk once). The patio is what first caught my attention, from the el. It's full of huge light-up signs that say ""Be Awesome"" and some other things, plus sort of shrouded in trees and just looks like the dream spot to eat pizza. Eating inside is cool too, though, and the sidewalk was really nice. Quiet and actually quite cute; the eating areas are partially covered, and surrounded by flower boxes and trees. The pizza is great. I LOVE that they have wheat crust. I hope it's whole wheat...it's a little ambiguous and I've never asked. In some spots they save ""whole wheat,"" others it's just ""wheat."" At any rate, it makes me feel a little less guilty about eating an entire pizza; that, and the fact that these are a true 10-11 inches...not the 14"" ""personal"" pizzas that I feel like are everywhere. They also have tons of different options. There isn't a ""Build Your Own"" option on the menu, technically, but there are so many options that you'll find something close to what you want, if not exactly it, and they're super good about substitutions. They've got a ton of toppings, too, and a bunch of different cheeses to choose from. I like that, because you really can create so many different sorts of flavor profiles... it elevates the pizza beyond typical pizza flavors. I will give one word of caution: pay attention to the base of the pizza you order. It's a little unclear in some menu descriptions, to me, that the base isn't tomato sauce. So, don't be like me and end up with a white pie when you were really pumped for some tomato action.My only final comment is that Homeslice is much better enjoyed at the restaurant than by delivery. My pizza wasn't cooked enough at all when it arrived via delivery (undercooked, and soggy/lukewarm as a result of travel is a bad combo). Not only that, but they forgot my tomato topping AND the online menu didn't make it clear, in my opinion, that this was a garlic and olive oil base, without tomato sauce. So, they left off my tomatoes, AND didn't put any tomato sauce. And then I had to cook it an extra 20 minutes in my oven. No joke. So, that was a disappointing experience...would have been way better had I been at the restaurant and able to have it fixed. (I did add some marinara sauce before cooking it, so was able to sort of fix the lack of tomato).Anyway, I really like Homeslice and think it's the perfect place to go with a few friends for good ol' pizza and beer. Oh yeah, they have a decent beer list, too. They definitely try at it... a little more ale-focused (read: hoppy) than I'd like, but good options if you like that stuff. Plus some good standbys on draft, and more on bottles/cans. Service has always been just fine... somewhat slow, and not friendly or especially welcoming. But otherwise attentive and pretty good."

In addition to great food, a full bar and a decent selection of regional beers, I really enjoyed the incredible interior. Inside, the ceiling, the tables, and some of the walls are made of wood, giving Home Slice a wonderful highlander-like feeling. Considering I was in the company of just one other person, we agreed to share the table with other guests, which created a commune table-like feeling - something we really enjoyed. It gave us the opportunity to meet interesting people. I also appreciated the fact that upon arrival, we were welcomed by the owner who told us the entire story of how Homeslide came to be. Some of the things I liked the most:1. The penny bathroom - the entire floor as well as one entire wall is made of US pennies. (both M and F bathrooms)2. Unique pizza names3. Regional beers"

I couldn't have been any happier from the moment we came until we left. Service was very attentive and with a genuine smile, not in a hurry and with some conversation (Brought me a refill without asking. I like that!) The decor is original and on the money. Very hip and a happening place. Big windows were opened to outside so you could feel the city, And hear the el trains. The pizza was made with fresh ingredients and the taste was unbelievable for a pizza. I usually never get a pizza with so many extras, but, what the heck-live a little! One veg pizza had broccoli, olives, roasted garlic, portabella mushrooms with feta and mozzarella. Prices were very reasonable. They have some long hand-carved wooden tables for big groups. Parking is on the street with meters for $2/hr. This is how a business should be run. And the neighborhood was so energetic. I left with a full belly but didn't feel weighted down. We will go back."

Great pizza! We had a specialty pizza with chicken and veggies. I really liked the crust too! They have a lot of different choices (maybe a bit too many to be honest), it's hard to pick just one. The service was excellent. The atmosphere is real neat, it's sort of like a ski lodge with a bit of glitz (they have shiny gold mirror bead-like things around the bar). Plus 2 huge TV's that I would think would have sports on at night. I think they've only been open for a little while.However in Chicago the pizza competition is fierce.....I hope they stick around for a bit. I would return."

A few things Homeslice did which made our experience actually pleasant -- took our cell and called us when our table was ready so we could play outside with our daughter nearby. They don't take reservations and wouldn't give us an estimate, but told us we were 3rd on the list which was good enough for us. Secondly, When we were called in, we got a corner booth and a high chair. The tables are all bar-high, but they have high chairs that are made for their table height which is great as I've been to other restaurants where they just stack a few high chairs which really isn't that safe. Third, our waitress was upbeat and friendly, and without asking brought us some blank paper and a few crayons midway through our wait. II had a wonderful pinot noir by the glass and my husband was pleased with the beer selection. We had a large pepperoni pizza and also bread sticks with goat cheese, and brought home more than half a pizza (which was totally our goal as we love leftover pizza in the house!). We will totally be back to this Lincoln Park spot with our family and will also recommend it to others. The owner/manager (not sure who, but you knew he was in charge) helped us on our way out and asked about our experience. I also saw him bussing food. I think that's a great way to run the show, so I hope he continues to be present on a regular basis."

There was a bit of a wait (to be expected on Saturday night) but the managers made us feel comfortable waiting from the minute we walked in. Great space. Very inviting. Saw a few families which was a nice relief from some of the other spots in the area. They have a bar section that is a little bit away from the diner section so you get the best of both worlds.The pizza was very tasty. Ideally, I prefer pizza that is a bit more on the well done side however this pizza stood up to some of the best I have had in this city. The Knife and Forkner is ace. They have 30+ options and you can make your own if you want to. I will return."

Finally the new pizza joint was open for business! Homeslice was worth the wait. Wonderful atmosphere and charming wait staff. The noise level was lively without being overwhelming. We will certainly go to Homeslice again.My husband and I shared a small ""Sheffield"" salad that was very generously sized. We went on to build our own pie. We stuck with our old tried and true cheese and sausage-delicious. The crust had a unique taste that I enjoyed. Next time we will more adventurous and go for one of the many appealing combos on the menu.Homeslice is a great addition to our neighborhood pizza selections. I recommended it to a friend who was very happy with his experience. I recommend Homeslice to you too."

The place is located in the Lincoln Park neighborhood. If driving there is street parking available. Homeslice is decorated pretty neatly. The theme is based on tree logs. Tables, booths, and bar have tree logs all around. The bathrooms are neatly decorated with pennies all over (floor, walls and ceiling). The food is very good with great taste. One can taste they are using the freshest ingredients. Items ordered: pizza, yucatan lime with chicken soup, smoked ham and avocado calzone. The food was brought out timely. Waiting for a table was not too bad but be prepared to wait for a long time specially if visiting during weekend. The waiting area is very small so I would recommend walking around the neighborhood (there are plenty of shopping places) while waiting (unless it is winter).Besides having great tasting food it is also a great value. It is best for groups. The place is loud so be prepared to speak up in conversations.As if food, location, decor weren't great already...per Homeslice's packaging it is endorsed by the Green Restaurant Association (dinegreen.com)."

People would line up every morning to get fresh pastries and cookies and cakes and pies. But all of those bakeries have closed. So my wife and I have to stray a long way from home to find fresh goodies. Is Wal-Mart in Sandwich far enough? And where am I going to go to find a bakery to make my mother's birthday cake this year? Well, Sweet Mandy B's at 1208 West Webster Avenue is a good start. Established in 2002, it is a bakeshop for old-fashioned treats from cupcakes to pies to cookies to breakfast bites. By most accounts, Sweet Mandy B's ranks among the top 10 bakeries in Chicago. So why can't she open a location in the Old Town neighborhood? For the time being, at least, we'll have to settle for West Webster. You can't go to Sweet Mandy B's and order just one or two items. I always get a few cinnamon rolls, a loaf of banana bread and a loaf of pumpkin bread and a bag of chocolate chip cookies and a German chocolate brownie. Pies? I can't pass up key lime or pecan or apple. Cake? How about Devils Food with raspberry filling and chocolate icing? And have you tasted Sweet Mandy B's pineapple upside down cake? I'm sure every customer has his or her favorites. That's the fun of going to Sweet Mandy B's, choosing which items and flavors you prefer. Who's counting calories?"

You know, the traditional bakery, where you could smell the pies and cakes and cookies and cupcakes being made in the kitchen, where folks from the neighborhood lined up on Saturday and Sunday mornings to buy fresh and hot danish and rolls. Well, Sweet Mandy B's at 1208 West Webster is the last of a dying breed. They produce old-fashioned desserts, including dreamy, creamy cupcakes, acclaimed the best in town. But there is so much more, like the chocolate and yellow cakes slathered in a colorful array of buttercream. And don't forget the puddings, an item you rarely see in any bakery. I'm particular to the butterscotch pudding but you might be partial to the chocolate or banana. The only way to enjoy a cake (yellow, Devil's Food, lemon, Red Velvet, banana, banana chocolate, strawberry, carrot) is to order a six-inch, three-layer variety and take it home. It's good for 8 to 12 servings. You won't regret it. But how can you resist the angel food cake, caramel apple cake, cinnamon rolls, banana bread, pumpkin bread, muffins, raspberry or fudge brownie bar, apple or key lime or pecan or coconut cream or chocolate cream pie or chocolate chip cookies? The fresh aroma from the kitchen challenges you to choose only one or two items. Fortunately, we don't live too far away from Sweet Mandy B's so we can stop by whenever our sweet teeth beckon. Which is often. My only regret? I wish they would add German chocolate cake, my favorite, to their menu."

I wanted cupcakes for a small celebration. Over the phone, I was guided to some options and was offered a great deal of suggestions and assistance. A bonus.... Mandy B's delivered my cupcakes to the restaurant where our celebration was going to be held. There was a nominal delivery fee and a two-hour window. The cupcakes arrived intact. The caterer at the restaurant and the bakery worked well together to provide this service that they seemed to have done many times before. The cupcakes were sooooo delicious. We could hardly eat our dinner waiting to dig into the sweet devil's food and yellow cupcakes with chocolate and vanilla buttercream frosting, filled with chocolate pudding. The pricing was around $3.50 per cupcake for these particular choices. Well worth the price for the deliciousness and the service provided. Definitely will go there in person to see what other pastries and cakes they have."

Whenever I go somewhere I have to check for a cupcake place (well and Donuts too but I was already a donut searcher LOL). So though I only live about 45 miles out of Chicago, I hadn't actually gone and looked into too many cupcake sellers until I did a couple 'staycations'. Sweet Mandy B's was on staycation #2.First off, it's not JUST a cupcake place but a full service bakery. It's in a very cute, residential area which is fun in itself and has a really charming feel and look. I ordered 4 cupcakes since that was what I came for but I found that there was a ton of other things to choose from and I ended up walking out of there with 3 other bakery items. Thank goodness I had 3 days to eat it all LOL.The cupcakes are of medium size and tbh, of varying yummy-ness. The banana was delicious! It was a banana bread type cupcake with chocolate frosting and though that doesn't sound like anything too special, it was very moist and just really tasty. The Cookie Monster one (which has a bottom this is a baked chocolate chip cookie) was too sweet for my taste. The PB cup wad dry so disappointing but the final one I bought, Snickerdoodle was like the banana...very yummy. So...that's 50% awesome and 50%, eh. Could be better but also worse. I at least know which to buy again and which to pass up.The bakery items were all good quality though. Nothing dry. I bought a huge raspberry bar tha was very good and had a lot of the delicious crumble topping. I also bought a lemon square but tbh, it was too tart for me but that is more a personal opinion. Others may really like that. The final item, a mint brownie was good but slightly too sweet though I would still say a tasty snack.Overall I'd come here again as there were a few more flavors of cupcakes I'd like to try and a few more bakery items too. Even the few things I didn't like, with the exception of the one dry cupcake, were of good quality so I'd say give this place a try. There's something for everyone! =o)"

Sweet Mandy B's may not be run by a top pastry chef from a French culinary school, but it is one of the best places in the city to escape to some of the sweet treats that remind you of childhood. I am a sweet addict. I don't have a sweet tooth, no unfortunately, I am addicted to baked goods. Sad, but true. You can imagine the awe I experienced when walking into this bakery shop that looks, feels and smells like a bakery should look, feel and smell. From the brightly decorated awnings on the outside to the smell of baked goods on the inside - I was immediately a fan.I looked at the first counter filled with bars, cookies, rice crispy treats and all things not cupcakes and pies. I then stopped in front of their second counter full of cupcakes, cake slices and pies. Wow...it can't possibly taste as good as it looks, right? I have been fooled before! But it is! It is just as good as it looks!So, for my very first visit, I purchased six cupcakes. I purchased vanilla on vanilla, vanilla on chocolate, banana chocolate, red velvet, confetti and cookie monster. So, by far, my favorite is confetti and cookie monster. Nom, nom, nom!!! The cupcakes are moist, but still moist enough to have a bit of a crumble. The flavor of the cake is absolutely delish! However, the buttercream sells it for me every time! The buttercream is OMG-this-is-so-good-I-could-eat-it-with-a-crane-sized-fork good! I am not sure how they make their buttercream, however I am amazed every time. The second time I visited, I purchased chocolate chip cookies, cupcakes and an apple cherry pie. The chocolate chip cookies were decent, however not my favorite. The pie was delicious! The crumb on the pie was sweet, but not too sweet. The apple cherry filling had just the right amount of sugar and flavor. Yum!So, now whenever I make my way to Lincoln Park, I am driving like a sugar crazed fiend to make my way to Sweet Mandy B's. Trust me, go, do not say that you have been to all kinds of bakeries and you can have cupcakes at home. I thought the same way too! Sweet Mandy B's is a special little bakery with the best baked goods in town!"

How they essentially swim in juice but stay crispy is beyond comprehension. They were absolutely delicious.My colleague has the chicken Tina Fey loves. It was good. Very juicy. I expected more spices but I enjoyed it. I had the skirt steak. It was far more flavored, but a tad salty for me.The salad was great with the addition of the fresh feta.

They are known for their roast chicken, and it is indeed excellent and not at all greasy, though it does come with a sauce that famously coast the Greek style potatoes. A lot of people were getting to go orders, but Athenian Room is definitely an ""eat in"" place where you can relax, get comfortable and people watch while you eat. The wait staff does not serve alcohol, but if you want a drink with your meal there is a bar attached to the restaurant and you can just walk on over and get a drink to bring back to the table.

So this review is about the Kalamata chicken (or ""Tina Fey chicken"" as I like to call it), which both my husband and I ordered. It was divine! For something like $12.95, you start out with a respectable salad of lettuce, tomato, and cucumber and an individual basket of bread. Don't eat too much of the latter, as you'll want to have plenty of room for the roasted half-chicken that is served on a bed of steak fries with the most scrumptious jus -- perfectly seasoned with lemon, oregano and other herbs. The jus makes this dish. I'm sorry we waited so long to try it! We'll definitely go back for more. (And a friend recommends the skirt steak with feta, too.)"

Recently, we visited the Athenian Room at 807 West Webster, in the heart of our Lincoln Park neighborhood, on the amazing and burgeoning Webster Avenue restaurant/bar/bakery corridor. The Athenian Room is very agreeable to our taste, casual and traditional thanks to a menu of basic dishes done right, including chicken and juice-soaked fries and salad. It also features low prices, large portions, friendly service and a laid-back atmosphere, all to our liking. It will take time for us to become familiar with the Spanikopita and the Souvlaki and the Taramosalata and the Gyros salad and the Kalamata chicken. We're told that TV star Tina Fey turned the Athenian Room into a place-to-go and place-to-be-seen and culinary rock star when the one-time North Side resident responded to a viewer's question about her favorite Chicago restaurants by offering a glowing review of the the Athenian Room's roasted chicken on a bed of steak fries. The kitchen is located in the front, the menu is limited and the decor isn't out of Architectural Digest. But the food makes it work. The more items you sample, the more Greek you become. I started with shrimp and Kalamata olives and a small Greek salad, then chose the shish Kebobbed pork tenderloin. My wife was enamored with the shish Kebobbed chicken breast. Dessert?

I did eat the whole thing, and we walked it off around the neighborhood. Parking could be a bit of a problem, it's just street parking, though they may have had a sign out for valet parking.

It feels like it's been there for decades; the phone even rings instead of chirping. I'd heard about the Kalamata Chicken and figured it was worth a try. Three of us went there on a Friday night, were greeted warmly and seated in the crowded dining room. The restaurant doesn't have a liquor license but you can go to the next door bar to get a drink and bring it back. We ordered spanakopita to split as a starter. It was warm and tasty. A very basic Greek salad came with the dinners and we added a side order of feta. Then the Kalamata Chicken arrived in all its messy glory. It's a crisp roasted half chicken on top of Greek fries, all drenched in a thin lemony vinegary sauce. It was really tasty. The potatoes soaked up the sauce without getting soggy. Magic? Maybe. One of my companions had the skirt steak which was also drenched in a thin sauce and said it was delicious and better quality than more expensive steaks he'd had. We ended the meal with baklava, the only dessert on the menu, but, when you have baklava, you really don't need anything else. Three dinners with a shared starter and three desserts came in at about $50. Good food. Good value."

The place is also chock full of teenagers and parents with young children, so it's not too much of a date place. Better for a couple of friends or family. I will always go here when I'm craving gyros, but if I want anything else, I'll head south."

If you want Greek food, this is not the place. If you're after Gyros, salad or roast chicken a step above fast food, the place moves up to average. I have a couple tests of a Greek restaurant, and this one failed them. Taramosalata ... should be made with potato or bread (or both) mixed with roe providing anywhere from a moderate to a robustly fishy taste. It should be pink to beige, depending on the roe used. This one, nada. It tastes like cream cheese mixed with lemon juice, some olive oil and a little onion; the barest hint of fish flavor. Greek salad ... should have plenty of onion, tomato and olive in addition to the lettuce, and a dressing you want to sop up with lots of bread. Athenian - 0 for 3 on that one too. The roast chicken was dry. The chicken kabobs likewise, and had to be cut with a knife. These are common failings, but not for a 4- or 5-rated place. Service was matter of fact and inattentive.

The Gyros stands out among other gyro joints in town. The Greek salad with feta is so good and the salty kalamata olives are a great touch. I love these items so much, its all that I've eaten in the years we have been going there. Oh, they do serve an awesome lemon-rice soup, only during the winter months. The soup has a rich lemon flavor without being tart. They do have the traditional Greek baklava and serve a good cup of coffee. Weekdays is the best time to go.

The service was wonderful, from a yound lady named Krissy. She was very kind to us, and she didn't rush us as we spent time catching up with our friend. Krissy was an excellent waitress and helpful with any questions we had.

There is a metro stop near them, but we were driving, and it wasn't too difficult to find free parking in the nieghborhood, which is a rarity in Chicago where you pay about $4/hour on the metered street parking.

It is in a nice area of the city and it offers a nice ambience. While they don't have outdoor seating they can open their entire window front which is great especially on warm days. The menu is appealing and it offers a nice selection of different food. The staff was very friendly, but they do have service issues. Not sure if the kitchen is understaffed, but the food takes quite some time to arrive. The more packed it is the worse it gets. While the staff is trying to handle delays with a friendly smile it appears that most of the waitresses don't have much experience working in a place like this. Their lack of attention when people are finished eating or water glasses to be refilled is somewhat disturbing. It reminds me of restaurants in Europe where you can sit for a long time and talk to your friends while waiting for your food. As nobody expects the food to come out fast they'd be fine, but in a place where many people come with kids they should change their service recipe and improve the speed in the kitchen and of the wait staff.

The Range has a list of their major food vendors on the bottom of their menu, which I appreciate. You know that they have developed a good relationship with local growers/butchers, and are buying quality ingredients. Two diners started with carrot soup, which looked wonderful and which they said was quite good. A great way to start a meal on a cold, cold night.For mains, one diner had the bacon flatbread and some had a veggie flatbread (I believe it was mushroom) that's no longer on the menu (because they serve only what's fresh.) I had the roasted half chicken. I loved the chicken -- very tender and the skin was crispy and so flavorful. Under the chicken were pickled veggies - carrots and greenbeans. Amazing! I love pickled vegetables, and these were delicious and complemented the chicken perfectly. There were some roasted potatoes to top off the dish. The wine and beer lists offered a good variety.

I am not really vegetarian (OK, maybe I'm a crypto-vegetarian). However, I like to try different vegetarian entries. Veggie burgers in general are tricky, because lesser establishments try too hard to make them look, feel and taste like the regular variety. Not Range. Their burger patty tastes like, well, like a delicious vegetable patty---sweet potato, pumpkin, rice, and more. Love it! The chicken sandwich, with red cabbage slaw and goat cheese, was also a hit at our table. The ambiance is elegant and quirky enough to be interesting (note the ""grass"" ceiling). In addition, the staff was extremely good at addressing our serious allergy concerns; it's usually a good sign when the waiter points out that they take ""cross-contamination"" very seriously, without me or my wife asking."

The best thing we had at Range was by far the herbed french fries. The were seasoned perfectly and perfectly crisp. No comment on the parking, we walked from a nearby apartment.

Range Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g35805-d5456190-Reviews-Range_Restaurant-Chicago_Illinois.html,"March 24, 2014",3,*sigh* - I'm calling it now - another restaurant that will fail in this location,"There were definitely a few issues when my husband and I met another couple here for dinner on a Friday night:1. No valet parking. This is a huge deterrent, pretty much making the restaurant rely on foot traffic. It took our friends 20 min to park. Being so close to DePaul, you would think the restaurant could make a deal for some spots.2. Lack of non-alcoholic beverages. My friend and I are both pregnant. Despite it being on their menu, they were out of lemonade and originally out of iced tea (they made some for us). They also don't stock cranberry juice. We felt very limited with what we could drink initially - just club soda with lemon.3. Slow service. When we first sat down, we were still waiting for our friends. Our waiter was very quick to take our drink order. He was also quick to take our friends' drink orders when they arrived. Everything after that was sllloooow. Though the food arrived quickly, the waiter waited a very long time to come back to our table initially to order apps, then dinner. The dinner took just under 3 hours.4. The food. I actually really enjoyed almost everything I had. We got the cheese plate for an app, which was fantastic. The butternut squash flatbread (also for an app) was just ok. It was pretty dry and not too much flavor. I ordered the fried chicken and my friend ordered the burger - both were good. However, our two catholic husbands found it difficult to order anything off the menu without meat (we visited during lent). My husband had buffalo cauliflower (very good but served in huge chunks instead of bit sized pieces) and mac & cheese. The mac and cheese was on the kid's menu and it tasted like noodles with olive oil and garlic. I'm not sure how they think a kid would think that tastes like mac & cheese when we barely got any flavor from it. My friend's husband ordered two grilled cheeses, also off the kid's menu, and there was barely any cheese on the bread. Unfortunately both of them left hungry.So, in the end, the only things we liked were the cheese plate, fried chicken and burger. Though the service was slow, everyone was very nice.It's just not a place I would go back to. Perhaps they need to turn this spot into retail."

This large, family style restaurant is perfect for group dining. Also, the patio provides a romantic setting for date nights under the lights. The pizza is the closest to authentic Napoli pizza that I have ever tasted. The only thing that keeps it from being truly authentic is that each slice is cut. Some people may prefer their pizza to be sliced especially if they are sharing, but I prefer the fun of slicing and dicing your pizza any way you like it, the Neopolitan way! I learned from my family that lives right in the crazy Napoli city center and always crave a simple margherita pizza consistently cooked to perfection. We ordered a buffala margeherita pizza and the arugula salad with prosciutto and Parmesan. I am excited to go back to try the pasta and have been very impressed by their expansive menu options. We are lucky to be able to walk to this authentic pizzeria in the neighborhood. The craft beer selection is all imported from Italy and Europe, and beer list gets a little pricey, but they do have a list of reasonably priced glasses and bottles of wine. The service was spot on! They were very accommodating and flexible. Everything was well timed, and it's a very casual friendly environment. Bravo, da Nella!"

My wife, who once worked in New York for eight years, insists New York-style pizza is very good. But I ignore her. In Chicago, you are treated to every kind of pizza there is--thin crust, pan, deep dish, Neapolitan, New York--so you can speak with some expertise on the subject. I am addicted to thin crust, cheese and sausage, but every once in a while I will sample others that are highly recommended by friends or food critics or other travelers. How we missed Pizzeria da Nella Cucina Nepolatana at 1443 West Fullerton, I don't know. It's in our Lincoln Park neighborhood and it produces classic Neapoitan pizza from a wood-oven stove that is operated by a Naples native whose passion for Italian food is only matched by her experience with pizza. They really take pizza seriously. The mixture of dough, yeast, water and sliced mozzarella isn't just a delicious dish, it is a passion, only made better by crispy crusts, succulent sauces and a variety of fresh toppings. At Nella, you have to try the pizza. But the menu features creative spins on a wide array of pastas, salads and other Italian dishes. Start with bruschetta, fresh chopped tomatoes, garlic, basil, extra virgin olive oil topped with fresh mozzarella. Many versions of bruschetta don't use cheese. I enjoy either kind. Without too much mozzarella, Nella's was excellent. The spinach salad with onion, red peppers, balsamic vinegar and extra virgin olive oil was a keeper, too. For entrees, we gave five stars to the Salmone dello Chef (filet of wild salmon) and Pollo alla Saltimbocca (chicken breast sauteed with fresh mozzarella, prosciutto and spinach). For dessert, we shared tiramisu, as good as we have tasted anywhere. This is a traditional Italian restaurant, old school, not a conventional one. The recipes are unique and original. When I reminded my wife that she had overlooked one of her favorites, Pesce Marino (black and wild Mahi-Mahi on a bed of shrip and scallop risoto), she vowed to order it on our next trip to Nella's."

Appetizers are served in large portions: we had crispy, not heavy fried calamari, bruschetta, prosciutto and bufala mozzarella, all abundant and satisfying. Again, pizzas were flawless and yummy. Don't miss the desserts, like semifreddo alla Nutella or the baba (a bit more Rhum would have made it perfect!).

Apples to apples. You can't compare this stuff to a deep dish place or Domino's...It was good, but as is often the case with this style of pizza, the middle of the pizza is consistently mushy, often totally mushy and completely lacking in any sort of structural integrity. Flavors very good, crust very nice on the edge and near the edge, but after 4 pizzas here, the middle was completely soft and wet- soaking wet in fact, and not so fun to eat. You HAVE to fold it up and roll it into the drier edge crust. I'm Italian and recognize/kind of don't like the superior aire in the air at here. I'm used to it and don't think a complain/comment at a place like this about the super soggy center would be well received. Having said that, i'll go there again, give it another chance, and if the pizza comes out watery in the middle, I'll say something and see how they take the feedback. If it's like i expect, like I'm a stupid American who doesn't get it, i'll come back here and give them a 3 star review. If they take the criticism and act genuinely interested, and tell me how to avoid it in the future by asking or something, i'll give them 5 stars. If I get the quiet cold shoulder, i'll do nothing. Good luck!"

It consists of a large, plainly decorated dining room with a long bar and an outdoor patio adjacent to the side of its building. This restaurant specializes in wood fired Neapolitan style pizza and also offers appetizers, salads, and a very limited number of pastas and other entrées.Our party of four recently dined there on an early Sunday evening. We started with the Calamari Fritti. It was spongy and salty rather than crisp on the outside and tender on the inside. Next we had three Neapolitan pizzas consisting of the Bufalina (bufala cheese, basil, and tomato sauce), the Funghi e Salsiccia (mushrooms, mozzarella cheese, and tomato sauce), and the Ortolana (medley of vegetables, mozzarella cheese, and tomato sauce). All three were satisfactory but far from special. Wine by the glass was overpriced and small pours.Service was extremely slow. We had to wait a very long time to be served our drinks and experienced another very long interval between receiving our antipasto and ordering our pizzas. Moreover, the service was inept. We had to ask our waiter three times for some extra napkins, and he served a glass of white wine instead of the ordered red, which had to be returned causing further delays.Metered street parking is available but can difficult to find.Mediocre food, poor value, incompetent service, and parking problems all ensure that I won’t be returning."

Sandra was named Pastry Chef of the Year in 2015 at the prestigious Jean Banchet Awards. You can taste why by sampling the fresh breads, sandwiches, salads, French pastries, cookies, sweets and breakfast items on the menu at the Holls' Floriole Cafe & Bakery. Located at 1220 West Webster Avenue in Chicago's Lincoln Park neighborhood, west of Racine, it is open from 9 to 1 Wednesday through Sunday. Come early. The Holls offer breakfast and luncheon goodies and an array of European-style pastries. They established their business in 2010 and the line forms at the door. Have your order in mind before you step to the walk-up window. Our personal favorites are the cinnamon swirl raisin bread, oatmeal cherry cookies, salted honey baby pie with delicious custard filling, chocolate croissants, ham and cheese croissants and danish. Since three bakeries closed within the last two years in our Gold Coast neighborhood, Floriole Bakery is as close as it gets to fresh breads and pastries. Thanks, Sandra and Mathieu."

We picked it up and after a 10-minute ride were back at her apartment. When she opened it (and we transported it very carefully), the entire tart filling had flowed out of the tart. It was a horrible mess. She immediately called the bakery and the reason for my negative review is due to the way the staff handled her call. She offered to send photos and was given an email address that was incorrect. She called back and was told they did not need to see the photos but would give her a ""gift certificate"" for the bakery. There was never an apology. The baker was too busy to speak to her. The passion fruit tart is ""tricky."" There was no manager available. Noone ever called her back when they said they would. Finally, my daughter called back a few more times and eventually was told her account would be credited for the cost of the tart, but unbelievably, they could not look up what she paid, and would not take her word for what she said she was charged (they differed by several dollars). She will never be back. This bakery is apparently started by someone from Tartine in San Francisco, our absolute favorite bakery. I cannot imagine them handling a similar situation with such an unprofessional, uncaring, inept and downright offhanded manner. And really, if a tart is ""tricky"" to make, don't make it. This is supposed to be a professional bakery, not a home cook. If it's that ""tricky"" take it off your menu. If you can't make it, don't sell it. And if you screw up, own up. Take responsibility. Apologize for ruining an event. Make up for the mistake. None of the above happened. Unbelievable."

They are every bit as good as the first we tasted at the Ferry Plaza in San Francisco two weeks ago. A Caneles de Bordeaux is a tiny cake baked in a fluted mold that is more than golden brown on the outside and is airy and custardy on the inside. The flavor of the cake is rum and vanilla. You can eat the small cake in five bites by holding it in the palm of your hand. A fork would smush it. These are best eaten the day they are made. Indeed, I have not found a bakery that ships them. There must be a reason why. I phoned ahead on a Saturday in July, and they told me they had a dozen left, so they held eight of these for me. When we arrived by taxi, they had about ten more left, and my mother bought six. She ate one on the spot with her cappucino and said they are the best thing she has ever eaten in her whole life. When I tasted my first in San Francisco two weeks ago, I proclaimed, ""This is the last thing I want to taste before I go to heaven."" You can see that we rate these highly. I have read that Floriole Bakery is praised for many other things, but we only experienced the very best thing they make, Caneles de Bordeaux. I cannot find a single place in my home state of Michigan that makes these, but I have ordered the fluted mold in order to learn how to make this delicacy myself. "

I have to say it’s become a love hate relationship. We loved and love the ambiance of this neighborhood restaurant with sophisticated food in an area dominated by college bars. At one time I’d estimate we would eat there once or twice a week. Then John (the owner) decided to limit his wine pours to the bare minimum limit. I always wonder why restaurants that get a hefty bill for each table turn decide to chinch on alcohol which is high margin and represents a small portion of the total bill. The math just doesn’t work. And when I mentioned my frustration personally to John, he literally blew me off. So...down to once a month. Most recently I’ve noticed that the food quality and taste varies greatly by visit. From amazing (as it always had been) to bland and underwhelming. I hosted a table of 12, most of whom had eaten there before and enjoy Tarantino’s, 2 months ago and it was uniformly terrible. So...down to: “let’s give it one more try”.I’m not sure what’s up here. Maybe John has lost his drive or is distracted. But I hope he wakes up. There’s a reason he has empty tables at night when you can barely get in to his completion within a small radius at the same time.

Medium well and tender. I couldn't have asked for more. My wife traces her bloodlines to northern Italy so the menu excited her from the grilled polenta to the apricot crusted rack of lamb with rosemary mashed potatoes and brussels sprouts. I passed up the high recommended mixed heirloom tomato salad with fresh mozzarella in favor of the parmesan shrimp. What can I say? I'm a sucker for a tasty shrimp dish. The filet mignon with mushrooms and asparagus and green beans and rosemary whipped potatoes was a culinary masterpiece. Next time I'll probably order the 16-ounce bone-in ribeye.

We used to go 3 times a week, then down to 2 and now once every so often. Why? First, the food, which was always excellent is now spotty at best. Even basic staples vary widely. Second, they nickel and dime patrons on pours and cocktails, which basically causes you to choose other restaurants unless you're completely a tea totaler. This place is not cheap, margins on wine and beer are sky high, so why piss customers off and make them dine elsewhere. Third, the owner John, who these days spends his time attached to the bar and whatever woman he has with him, or in Florida...JUST DOESNT CARE.We live in the neighborhood, I've mentioned the above points to John directly several times. He either doesn't care care or has some other inability to read the tea leaves. On nights when there is a wait at nearby, less famous restaurants in Lincoln Park, Tarantinos is empty or closes early. The staff turnover, for such an icon, is through the roof. Portions are smaller, quality is inconsistent (or absent), they cut corners at the bar (really? What's the profit margin on liquor) and the writing is on the wall. The recession is over and they empty early and fail miserably to live up to their historic reputation.Same management, so no blame there. It's simply this. John, wake up, focus or sell to someone who can bring Lincoln Park what it desperately needs. Adult restaurants where the folks in the brownstones and town houses will spend freely for get good food and generous treatment."

They had a very nice selection, including some special twists. For example, they did have Eggs Benedict but they also had Italian Eggs Benedict and more. We also tried their stuffed French toast - oh! and their breakfasts sandwich. Yes, they do have jams and they can bring you honey for your toast. Delicious coffee as well. We actually will return on purpose to have breakfast here and likely even to try out their lunch menu!"

We had the baked scallops and they were wonderful!  There were eleven of us at the table and we were all in a corner but the mirrors on the wall helped us all feel like we were not claustrophobic. Service was very good and they kept up with both giving us water and drinks well. The one negative to this place is parking. However there is pay for parking around the neighborhood.
Sai Cafe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g35805-d430805-Reviews-Sai_Cafe-Chicago_Illinois.html,"September 29, 2014",5,Fantastic dinner!,"Before we left Chicago, I was determined to have Sushi and looked at a number of places. Being in a quiet neighborhood was a concern, but that concern quickly went away when we arrived in Lincoln Park to find Sai. Certainly a busy commercial area so take advantage of the valet parking (or enjoy a pleasant walk).The food was great,portions the right size. We did share a roll that was only 4 slices BUT each slice was size of a small child's hand (definitely could not use chopsticks to pick it up).It was not busy so the wait staff was constantly filling our glasses and checking on us. That was a little over the top but understandable.It was a 30 min drive from the Hyde Park area but I'd do it again in a heartbeat."

Incredible sushi, if you like nigiri the portions are very generous. If you don't eat sushi, their other food is great too. Service is friendly and quick. The restaurant also has a cozy and romantic atmosphere, nothing is better than sitting in one of their booths by the window. Lastly, they have a varied and reasonably priced drink list, which is hard to find at a sushi restaurant in the city."

Nigiri was all fresh and we particularly enjoyed the Spicy Scallops and Spanish Mackerel. Service was impeccable and fast. The owner checked in with us several times and provided recommendations. We look forward to returning when we are hungrier to try the Omasake- their version of Omakase. A solid recommendation to anyone looking for sushi in Lincoln Park right near the Armitage brown line."

I'm not going to rave about this place because I've been to some really great restaurants in the area and this was not one of them. But it is a totally respectable joint and I wouldn't think twice about going again. Service was good and the ambience is nice as well.

When I visit Chicago again in the future, I will be back for a meal at Sai!"

Big mistake! The sushi was just barely average. My chicken teriyaki came to the table stone cold and had only small slices of chicken. But the service was horrendous! It didn't appear as though servers had been assigned to tables and we have 5 - 6 flitting around the table. They constantly asked if we were finished with things - and started to take them away - when we were clearly not done. They moved food around and seemed to be in some kind of weird hurry. We were definitely not be back.

I read up on Nookies and then found Nookies Too was near DePaul, so we headed there for brunch. People do not lie when they say it's not easy getting a table in Lincoln Park for brunch. The hostess said 20 min, but I'm pretty sure we waited for about 40. It was an unseasonably warm day in Chicago in Feb, so we had no problem waiting outside in the sun, but I do not know where people would wait had it been a normal winter's day.This is an old diner on the smallish side. People are packed in and you are basically sitting next to your neighboring table. It's quite loud, at least where we were sitting, across from the kitchen. The service was ok, our waitress did not seem familiar with the menu and had to check on what came in hubby's pita and also told me that the Combo Crepes were strawberries AND blueberries, even tho the menu states OR. I asked for the Combo Crepes with strawberries and there was all of this confusion, but it may have been a language barrier more than anything else.I was planning on the Monte Cristo that I had read about in a review, but it turns out that must only be offered at Nookies, so I choose the Crepe Combo which was crepes with strawberries and cream cheese. My crepes were very good, perhaps a little overdone and crisp for my liking, but the strawberries and cream more than made up for it. There were three, so the best part were the left-overs for the college boy. Three of us also ordered hash browns, which were small diced potatoes fried up in literally no grease. They were very dry, but in a good way. We all liked them after seasoning them a bit.Vegetarian hubby ordered the Veggie Pita with vegetable soup. He said it was quite good and plentiful. Our younger son had the Strawberry Pancakes, which was three fluffy pancakes loaded with strawberries. He loved them and enjoyed every bite! Our college boy enjoys a hearty breakfast. He ordered the Sweet and Savory. I'm not quite sure what was included and what he possibly added, but he ate the following: pancakes with strawberries and chocolate chips (awesome), hash browns (amazing), bacon (he said nothing special) and scrambled eggs (his words: ""they are good, but really fluffy, kind of an odd texture, not sure I'd order them again"" but he ate them).We all shared a large orange juice to see what all of the rage was about on TA. If you have had freshly squeezed orange juice before, that's what it tastes like. I guess we're spoiled at home, because hubby makes it often. Skip the $5 glass of OJ.Overall, we enjoyed our meal, it was worth the wait and we were all stuffed for a good portion of the day."

We were offered coffee immediately upon sitting down, and it was kept hot and freshened the whole time.

We will definitely not be back and we do not recommend this place at all” I get the feeling that your experience at Macku (with our first server at least Tall, big build, Asian) can depend MASSIVELY on who you are and possibly even on how you look. My boyfriend and I went to celebrate our 7th anniversary last Saturday. We both work and go to school full time so date nights are rare and we had been looking forward to this all month. We had a reservation so we were sat quickly and noticed a few empty tables so we were looking forward to it being a smooth dinner. Our initial server, whose name I wish I would have caught must of thought we were deaf - He came to our table and loudly asked “What do you want to drink?” - No introduction, no chef specials, just those 6 words. We totally disregarded it, we were there to celebrate you know? I simply said “no not yet, we’d like to take a look at the menu first, thank you.” He grunted as he walked away and came back within a few minutes and loudly asked again “WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DRINK”, I told him we were ready to order some appetizers if he didn’t mind. Which of course he did, and he made sure to make it known, he said he wasn’t ready for an order and that he would be right back and walked away. He then left to take care of the table right next to us, in a gentle and very informative manner he explained the menu and took their order without any hesitation!!! Before becoming a nurse I’ve waited tables at many restaurants, because of that, I am always apt to cut servers a lot of slack but this guy was so rude and his treatment was simply inexcusable. I honestly don’t even know how or why we made it this far at this point. Anyhow as we were trying to order off the menu he would simply say NO, NO, NO WE DON’T HAVE THAT - Instead of suggesting what they did actually have because at this point it seemed as if they had nothing. We were able to order a few appetizers, sashimi, and our drinks. We received our food rather quickly, my boyfriend (FYI: HE IS A SUSHI CHEF downtown) asked for Wasabi and the server SCOLDED him and said he would ruin the sashimi with more wasabi and refused to bring it to the table. We asked a different server for the wasabi, and with no hesitation it was brought to us. Again, why are we still here? This is beyond ridiculous, it can’t possibly get any worse, can it? Ohhhh but it certainly can. After repeatedly seeing that same server kindly explain the menu to other tables, he came to our table and said “The chef’s have a big order coming so you have to order your entire meal right now if not you’re going to have to wait more than an hour for food so what do you want” 1. We were the ONLY table he said that too. 2. There were a few empty tables still and 3. We still hadn’t received the drinks we ordered more than 15 minutes prior and yet he was trying to kick us out?! After botching every possible aspect of our meal, I voiced my opinion to the manager. She sincerely apologized and offered us a Do Over with a different server. Nickolas was our second server and the experience difference was insane, he was fantastic and explained everything to us which we are grateful for - However, Terrible service can overpower any food, no matter how carefully prepared and delicious it may be. We will definitely not be back and we do not recommend this place at all."

OMG....,"I take people visiting - or groups of friends - here when I can - simply because it is consistently excellent and inventive. Recently I tried their Omakase option (chef's choice - ad-libbed as you go.) : on Thursday it was actually 30% off for their $75.00 Omakase menu - a GREAT value. Then one day, I ordered the option of the best quality seafood omakase. This was more expensive, but I asked to be told when I had reached my fiscal limit. Each dish was presented like a piece of art: on unique and inventive dishware - or huge seashells - or astounding sculptural serving plates. The dishes were unlike anything I had ever had: snails in incredible sauce; the freshest caviar on a spoon, langostina whose shells were so crisped that they were edible and delicious. An amazing experience. They also have an impressive Japanese whiskey collection - which my son-in-law loved. I only wish they carried a pink sparkling wine - my favorite accompaniment to sushi - and they brought back their prior mixed seafood caldron of soup (with quail egg and a variety of seafood, slightly spicy - delicious enough for a meal.)"

We will definitely not be back and we do not recommend this place at all” I get the feeling that your experience at Macku (with our first server at least Tall, big build, Asian) can depend MASSIVELY on who you are and possibly even on how you look. My boyfriend and I went to celebrate our 7th anniversary last Saturday. We both work and go to school full time so date nights are rare and we had been looking forward to this all month. We had a reservation so we were sat quickly and noticed a few empty tables so we were looking forward to it being a smooth dinner. Our initial server, whose name I wish I would have caught must of thought we were deaf - He came to our table and loudly asked “What do you want to drink?” - No introduction, no chef specials, just those 6 words. We totally disregarded it, we were there to celebrate you know? I simply said “no not yet, we’d like to take a look at the menu first, thank you.” He grunted as he walked away and came back within a few minutes and loudly asked again “WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DRINK”, I told him we were ready to order some appetizers if he didn’t mind. Which of course he did, and he made sure to make it known, he said he wasn’t ready for an order and that he would be right back and walked away. He then left to take care of the table right next to us, in a gentle and very informative manner he explained the menu and took their order without any hesitation!!! Before becoming a nurse I’ve waited tables at many restaurants, because of that, I am always apt to cut servers a lot of slack but this guy was so rude and his treatment was simply inexcusable. I honestly don’t even know how or why we made it this far at this point. Anyhow as we were trying to order off the menu he would simply say NO, NO, NO WE DON’T HAVE THAT - Instead of suggesting what they did actually have because at this point it seemed as if they had nothing. We were able to order a few appetizers, sashimi, and our drinks. We received our food rather quickly, my boyfriend (FYI: HE IS A SUSHI CHEF downtown) asked for Wasabi and the server SCOLDED him and said he would ruin the sashimi with more wasabi and refused to bring it to the table. We asked a different server for the wasabi, and with no hesitation it was brought to us. Again, why are we still here? This is beyond ridiculous, it can’t possibly get any worse, can it? Ohhhh but it certainly can. After repeatedly seeing that same server kindly explain the menu to other tables, he came to our table and said “The chef’s have a big order coming so you have to order your entire meal right now if not you’re going to have to wait more than an hour for food so what do you want” 1. We were the ONLY table he said that too. 2. There were a few empty tables still and 3. We still hadn’t received the drinks we ordered more than 15 minutes prior and yet he was trying to kick us out?! After botching every possible aspect of our meal, I voiced my opinion to the manager. She sincerely apologized and offered us a Do Over with a different server. Nickolas was our second server and the experience difference was insane, he was fantastic and explained everything to us which we are grateful for - However, Terrible service can overpower any food, no matter how carefully prepared and delicious it may be. We will definitely not be back and we do not recommend this place at all."

OMG....,"I take people visiting - or groups of friends - here when I can - simply because it is consistently excellent and inventive. Recently I tried their Omakase option (chef's choice - ad-libbed as you go.) : on Thursday it was actually 30% off for their $75.00 Omakase menu - a GREAT value. Then one day, I ordered the option of the best quality seafood omakase. This was more expensive, but I asked to be told when I had reached my fiscal limit. Each dish was presented like a piece of art: on unique and inventive dishware - or huge seashells - or astounding sculptural serving plates. The dishes were unlike anything I had ever had: snails in incredible sauce; the freshest caviar on a spoon, langostina whose shells were so crisped that they were edible and delicious. An amazing experience. They also have an impressive Japanese whiskey collection - which my son-in-law loved. I only wish they carried a pink sparkling wine - my favorite accompaniment to sushi - and they brought back their prior mixed seafood caldron of soup (with quail egg and a variety of seafood, slightly spicy - delicious enough for a meal.)"

The course in between was just fine, nothing we have not seen before. The hamashi sashimi was the only one we liked the most. The sushi maki was not even rolled to par with ingredients we thought was an after thought. The wait staff made a mistake to tell us that the Living Social coupon includes 2 free drinks/beer, but it turned out not.

Treated to an intimate window table - but within earshod of the sushi chef - the delightful 6-course meal began with a carrot soup reduction generously accented with lump crabmeat. The tempura whitefish shared appetizer was exquisite. But the squid-big eye tuna-sake sashimi was a sight to behold, graced with roasted garlic, microgreens, and shaved burdock. Unbelievable. Sashimi has always - in my experience - just been served with unadorned fish. The Macku version is so much more eye-appealing, and a gastronomic delight. The sweet potato sushi roll topped with a well-spiced tuna tartare was yet another delight. Two subsequent courses were wonderful, and we opted for the asparagus flan desert, so nicely prepared. Wine list is good, tho pricey. A great experience, and we will be back - even without a Groupon."

This kind of meal gets pretty pricey and, given that I didn't want it getting totally out of hand, the matter of fact way it was addressed was really helpful and made in easier to concentrate on the wonderful meal.

The sushi chef at Macku proved to us how wrong we had been. We ordered a chef's choice dinner (at slightly below the chef's recommended starting price point), and were served one delicious dish after another. Aside from the carrot soup to start (delicious, but not fish), almost all of the seafood we were served came in large bites of uncooked fish or shellfish, with fascinating garnish. Most were among the tastiest bites we've ever eaten, and those that didn't make that grade were good or interesting. Our favorites were the maguro sashimi and white tuna sashimi. The most memorable presentation was isake, fileted fish served whole, with the strips laid across the fish's back, to be dipped in soy sauce. What most surprised us about this meal is that only one dish was served with any rice, and that only a dollop lying beneath the bite of raw fish. We came in very skeptical of sushi, and left as total converts to good sashimi (i.e., raw fish served alone without rice accompaniment. In Japan a week later, we had breakfast at a restaurant near the Tsukiji Fish Market after the early morning tuna auction. It was good and very fresh, but it wasn't as good as the sashimi that Macku served us."

I went on line to make a reservation to celebrate my anniversary and saw that they have 2 restaurants. I knew that I wanted the one on Clybourn as it is much quieter than the one on Halsted, so I clicked on the Clybourn site and made an online reservation for dinner. We do this all of the time, easy right? When I went to make the reservation, I was re-directed to open table to complete the process, which I use all of the time, so I was happy to make my reservation this way, but.... when I arrived at the restaurant, they told me that my reservation was for the other location on Halsted and only the other location uses open table, not the original one on Clybourn. So why was I re-directed there to make the reservation? Not only that, but they would not give me the restaurant points since only one of their restaurants participates with open table. Had I not been re-directed on line to make the reservations, i would not have thought twice about it, but now that I was, and they wouldn't honor it, I was not happy. Really??? they only honor this at one restaurant and not the other? I don't like being misdirected and misled, so I'll now think twice about going back here, even though I've enjoyed it in the past. This created 2 strikes in my mind.Back to the other reason for three stars. As I mentioned, we have been coming here for years and my wife loves the Cod dinner and she loved the way that they made the Gomae. The Cod was as always very good, and a nice size portion, but they have cut down the portions by what seemed like more than 50%, as the meal was significantly smaller than it used to be. And the Gomae, although also quite tasty, used to be made with spinach, bananas, and peanut sauce, but the peanut sauce is now missing, so it's a bit more run of the mill than it used to be. Don't get me wrong, the food was good, but they rushed us so much that my dinner came out before I even had time to finish my soup. I don't know why they felt the need to rush us, on a Wednesday evening, they were not even close to being full, so they didn't need the table. I used to love this restaurant, now it's just another Asian restaurant, nothing special. All in all, just a so so experience."

I have been at the N. Clybourn restaurant many times throughout the year and without prior planning always have a hard time getting in at prime hours.Luckily, by opening up this new restaurant, many will have the ability to experience the taste of the Chef. My husband and I made last minute reservations. The new restaurant is much easier to get to, easier parking, bigger, more modern, and the atmosphere is slightly more formal but still very comfortable. Service was excellent, and very accommodating to my husband and my differences in food preferences.My husband and I chose to order Chef's choice. Unlike most restaurants where both parties must have the same food for each course, the Chef tailored each course according to our preferences. My husband wanted more typical sushi, and I wanted more non-typical options. Also, you let them know how much you want to spend per person and then they start sending beautiful and tasty courses out. We chose to spend $80 per person. Plus we also had a groupon so, it was much less than that.I have attached pictures of each of our course. We had at least 5 courses. First Course: White asparagus soup, and Not your typical Miso soup. Second Course: Me - risotto type dish, Husband - fresh salmon and a quail egg.Third Course: Ravioli with lobster broth. ( Would definitely order again)Fourth Course: Me - Seared Bison (melt in your mouth), Husband - bass with olives, citrus sauce.Fifth Course: Me - Black Cod with Shrimp (YUMMY), Husband - Fresh seafood, great presentation, and lettuce wrap type approach served in a beautiful bowl that was lit from the bottom. See picture to appreciate.Even after all these courses, we had more money left from the dollar value we had set for the chef. The last course that my husband chose was more raw sushi, and I opted for a custard dessert. Wow!! Pleasantly surprised with the dessert.This was high quality food, and what I considered very reasonable price for all the food we were served. The new restaurant was pretty, and suitable for a date and special occasions.Both Macku restaurants are my favorite Sushi restaurants for the quality of the food, creativity, and service."

My son has accompanied his friend to Macku a couple of times within the last several months and has extolled the quality of the food. Knowing that I had never eaten sushi, my son invited me to join the two of them to try it out. So on a weeknight in early March the three of us dined at Macku. It is located on north Clybourn St. in a lively section of town having numerous restaurants and bars. My son’s friend had made reservations for 7:30 p.m. and when my son and I arrived shortly before then, the friend was already seated at a well placed table in the rear end of the dining room. The restaurant, which is set up with tables as well as a counter with stools, seats approximately 46 and is very comfortable. On the night we were there it was bustling with customers.My son’s friend, who is a long-standing patron of this restaurant and well acquainted with the staff, graciously consented to do all the ordering. He was very ably assisted by our waiter John who was professional and extremely informative. As to what we ate, please understand that because I am a complete neophyte relative to sushi, I am not capable of providing the Japanese names of the approximately 10 dishes we shared. However, I can say that most of the food was either specially ordered or the special of the night. It included white tuna ceviche, asparagus soup with foie gras (the only dish that was cooked), tuna tartar, spring rolls, spicy tuna rolls, and asparagus pudding for dessert. Our meal was accompanied by a pouilly-fuissé that was selected in coordination with John.Prior to our dinner at Macku I had very mixed feelings as to what to expect. I thought that I probably would like some items, dislike some, and be indifferent to the rest. Well, I am extremely pleased to report that I was greatly surprised as to how phenomenally good all the food was. Everything was extremely fresh, wonderfully flavorful, very colorful, and beautifully presented. Most important, nothing in our food had the remotest hint of any “fishy” taste. Moreover, we all agreed that our wine, which was very tasty and refreshing, was the perfect accompaniment to our meal.

Creamy and indescribable carrot soup and signature sweet potato soup (to die for!) and outstanding white asparagus soup. Udon is also lovely. Broiled black cod entree with ""chocolate"" sauce (think Japanese mole!)- indescribably delicious. The various signature nigiri are a must! Delicate and nuanced and flavorful and creative. You will want multiples of each. I would say the regular rolls are not as impressive or unusual here. Go for their specialty items. Ask the waiter if in doubt. If you have the means and time, go for the omakase menu - where the chef picks what to prepare for you - depending on market availability and your budget and appetite! Macku has a nice selection of drinks and wines. Waitstaff is impeccable and helpful. Did I mention that the atmosphere is lovely and intimate without being stuffy?

I only wish we had a place like this to go to when I was in college. Opened in 2015 in the space once occupied by Via Carducci, Warehouse is run by Carmelo Scalzo, nephew of the former owner of Via Carducci, and cousin Agostino Femminella. They've added a modern touch to the growing popularity of sports bars. Warehouse has 15 TVs and a 28-foot-long bar and offers 16 draft beers and 40 brands in bottles and cans. You won't get thirsty here. And you won't go hungry, either, with a menu that seems to cover all bases. Start with pizza dough sticks or pizza rolls or nachos or wings or cheese curds or Monster fries, a unique and fascinating concoction of house-cut fries topped with shaved beef, bacon, Bolognese meat; sauce, pepperoni, mozzarella and fresh herbs. It's enough to make your eyes roll. Build your own pizza, Cajun (shrimp, Gouda and vinaigrette), Rustica (figs and Gorgonzola) or Angry Italian (spicy soppressata, giardiniera and sausage). They are a sharp alternative from Warehouse's traditional thin crust pizza. Maybe you'd just prefer a burger. Warehouse's Classic Burger is highly recommended, 1/2 pound of hamburger patty topped with American cheese, lettuce, tomato and onion on a brioche bun. On my last visit, I took a step back to my teenage years and ordered a bowl of tomato basil soup and a grilled cheese sandwich. That was my standard order in the 1950s. It still tastes good. Then top it off with a banana split or a bowl of gelato or sorbet. All sports bars should feed their customers like the Warehouse. If they did, you probably wouldn't have time to watch the game."

Yes my name is Pastrypants, and yes I have a problem.The location may not be super close to me, but anytime I'm in the Lincoln Park area, I am magnetized to Jeni's, day or night. Plenty of street parking, you enter through it's neighbor Foxtrot and then head inside towards the back where the flavors are in abundance. They have their signature flavors such as vanilla, brown butter almond brittle, different levels of chocolate, salted caramel and a salted pb. Below that are their limited edition flavors, usually a seasonal thing. There isn't a ton of seating, but I prefer the one little booth with a few comfy seats near the entrance. Otherwise, there are communal tables with barstools. Fresh flower vases adorn the tabletops. The staff is always super friendly and accommodating, even when I want to try like 6 different selections. The tasting spoons are actually little baby metal spoons, and the containers and spoons they give out are eco-friendly, and I appreciate not so much waste. Jeni was a James Beard award winner, and it shows through her ice creams. Crafted beautifully and such a great selection. If you want, they sell ready pints to go. Sure they are a bit pricey, but you get what you pay for. I like the fact that I can enjoy a fresh made waffle cone or even order 3 half scoops, so I don't have to feel like such an oinker, but still have a cute little threesome. teehee"

Their service is usually good, but last night they were hosting a party and they did not have enough staff on hand to properly serve their other customers. Despite our reservations we had to wait 15 minutes to be seated. Sometimes restaurants do find themselves in this unfortunate situation and graciously offer their patrons a complimentary glass of wine or tea. Dee's is a neighborhood restaurant. I expected them to treat their loyal patrons more thoughtfully. At the very end of our dinner, when we were leaving, the hostess did apologize for the slow service. My two dinner companions have a connection to this sweet neighborhood, so they may return. I, on the other hand don't share their sentimental connection, so I would probably not return to Dee's, but select instead a restaurant with a reputation for excellent service and good food. There are three critical elements of a great dining experience: good food, great dinner companions, and thoughtful, timely service. We had the first two elements; Dee's failed to deliver a critical element of the dining experience."

The first time no one came to take my order, today I ordered and waited and waited and 10 minutes before I had to leave I was presented with an entree that differed from the description. Big difference between tomato as on the menu and tomato sauce as delivered. I just got up and left. I can't eat a meal in 10 minutes no matter how fast I chew. To add insult the manager told me that the only table was available for a solo eater. No problem until I looked around and saw many four tops occupied by one. His answer was they were getting busy. While I waited and as I left there were many two tops and four tops he could have offered. I am highly disappointed in this location. I will not go back.

The ambiance is like a French market so comfortable and no rush to move on so that is a plus. You can't go wrong with the Quiche Lorraine - the most consistent offering I've found. Organic and vegan offerings are also a plus. Worth a visit, but be willing to overlook the inconsistent service and menu items."

We stopped here for breakfast by happenstance. My wife had a ham and cheese something or another sandwich and I had the waffle. The waffle was small but very dense and yummy. This was a fun stop and unique setting.

Everyone in my family likes something different - my wife and eldest child enjoy the Chinese, I like the Thai and our youngest loves the sushi. We usually order for pick-up, but dine in from time to time. I generally recommend pick-up as dine-in service can be somewhat slow (my only criticism), especially on Friday and weekends. Also, the prices are very reasonable; in fact, a bargain compared to other similar restaurants."

We also love the egg rolls. I did order the teriyaki chicken and the flavor was good but chicken was super dry. I still loved it and now order the steak. I order pick up here a few times a month and always love the food. I was however, taken aback when I asked for an extra pinch of peanuts on my pad thai online (totally expecting a small upcharge), but they charged me several dollars (same price as asking for extra shrimp loll)! I always ask for a side of [peanuts when I pick up my order] at the restaurant and never get charged. Its not a negative, but just insight from a regular :) Also, spicy tuna roll is DELICIOUS!"

We love noodle shops and it was near our hotel, so we decided to give it a try. The food was good and came out quickly. It appears to be premade and microwaved. The price was reasonable. It is not a traditional Asian Noodle House as we had hoped, so take that right out of your head….. The person taking the orders was very nice and efficient. The pick-up-the-table person was slow, slow, slow. Maybe it was his first job. Definitely needed an in-service on sweeping; if it is going to take 15 minutes to sweep around two chairs, it is better to move them, n’est pas?"
