Al Bawadi Restaurant,https://www.zomato.com/chicago/al-bawadi-restaurant-bridgeview/reviews,"Feb 08, 2018",4,The space is a little cramped but that is to be expected in an airport. I ordered the prime hanger steak but was not excited about the sides which were mac and cheese and steamed broccoli. It gave me a sort of cafeteria feel. The hanger steak was tender and juicy but had a some connective tissue like a strong thread tunning through it which I had to keep removing from my mouth. The broccoli was under steamed and so hard it was unedible. The mac and cheese was good but would have preferred mashed potatoes. Strangely enough my favorite thing was the way the hot tea is served. It comes in a little pot with lemon and honey on the side. Very nice presentation. Service was great.,Simran Pande,37960120,33461103,DINING

When the good did come our server never came over to see how the food was or if we needed anything at all. There were many busboys and servers waking around but nobody tended to our table.

I just paid 11.00 for a double cheeseburger and fries with no drink. I can have the same thing down the street for 8.00 They act like their food is gourmet. It's not like their meat is grass fed organic and hormone free. I feel cheated after going there today. I will now rethink how I spend my money. I have gone here for years. I will only be going now occasionally. And what gets me is you pay 22.00 for a full slab of ribs with no salad. And sometimes the ribs are fatty with not very much actual meat on them. Some days are better then other. The food here is definitely not consistently good. If you don't have a problem with the prices it can be a decent place to go to. It's not like the food is fantastic.
