Chez Joel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g35805-d428852-Reviews-Chez_Joel-Chicago_Illinois.html,28-Oct-21,5,very nice place,"The place is cozy, next to UIC campus. It is cozy and clean. The food is decent. The appetizers are exceptional, especially the baked clams and the octopus. Will go back again."
Chez Joel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g35805-d428852-Reviews-Chez_Joel-Chicago_Illinois.html,24-Oct-21,5,Awesome!,"As we love French food, this has become our go to place in the city. The food, service, and overall ambience are second to none, not to mention the prices are extremely reasonable. If you love escargot, theirs as an appetizer is phenomenal, traditional bourguignon style, finished off with a dash of Pernod and bread crumbs. Don’t even get me started the filet mignon, perfectly prepared to order, and mouthwatering. Many other delicious choices on the menu, you really can’t go wrong with anything cuisine wise here. Speaking of service, if you happen to have either Maggie or Nancy as your server, consider yourself lucky. These two ladies know what it means when it comes to customer service. Kudos to all for another wonderful evening last night and thanks so much for everything you did for yet another memorable evening for us."
Chez Joel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g35805-d428852-Reviews-Chez_Joel-Chicago_Illinois.html,2-Jul-21,4,A little off . . .,"Back after after a couple of years, this (and the family's previous Clark Street Bistro) had been favorites for decades. This time . . . the wait for a waiter (and a chance to order drinks) seemed forever. Bread (wonderful crusty bread) was delivered at last and nicely warmed, with butter accompaniment -- but no cutlery for way too long with which to spread the butter . . . as the bread cooled. Starters, once they got here (""in a second,"" promised the waiter, who, um, misspoke) were fine (my escargot, my wife's salad). Then another long, long wait (without explanation or inquiry re another drink, my martini being long-gone) -- until my wife's scallops (lovely and very good) and my poulet aux romarin (a surprisingly dry and flavorless roast half chicken, recommended by the waiter over the coq au vin) finally arrived. On the plus-side, prices remain reasonable (which sounds like an intro to an old joke, but no) and the small room pleasant (opt for the garden, if the weather's right); and inn fairness, perhaps things are still in some disarray as our restaurants recover from the pandemic, which in part kept us away for so long. So we'll give it a while before returning, watch the user reviews and hope they get their act together again soon."

Chez Joel is a wonderful little neighborhood restaurant located in little Italy between the two UIC campuses. They have valet parking and a beautiful shady patio. Their appetizers are yummy - sometimes we just order all appetizers and then have dessert!This is one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago - I seriously do not understand why there are no huge lines to get into this place. I think people think that French food will be too expensive - but most entrees are $20 - $25 dollars. From 4-6 PM they have a Prix Fixe menu that gives you a choice of appetizer, entrée and dessert for around $36.There is great food all over this neighborhood but this is right at the top - can almost always get in last minute with no waiting. They have valet parking. Or there is free street parking along Taylor.I have eaten lunch here but the dinner menu is better. They also have a nice wine list with many bottles priced at $40 or below"
Chez Joel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g35805-d428852-Reviews-Chez_Joel-Chicago_Illinois.html,31-Jul-20,5,Exquisite French Cuisine Casual quaint atmosphere ,"Chez Joel is one of my favorite French restaurants in Chicago; and I truly missed dining in during our pandemic. Last year I celebrated my birthday here and since Chez Joel finally reopened for dine in I decided to visit here this past Wednesday to enjoy their cute outdoor private patio. I prefer dining outside during the summer season; but if you prefer to sit inside there's ample room inside the bistro and no overcrowding. All the staff here is incredibly friendly and they work well as a team making sure you have enough bread, water and food.I love ordering their appetizers so I chose a cheese platter with fruit and walnuts and a rich and buttery tray of escargot.Their escargot is one of the best in the city of Chicago and the sauce is perfect with their crusty fresh baked bread baguette.The cheese plate comes with crispy toast points but if you need more bread it's always available to you. I think if you come here as a couple three sharable appetizers and a dessert are more than enough.I always have a wonderful dining experience here and if you dine here during a work week night you won't be rushed out because weekends tend to be busier here. I highly recommend you call ahead for reserved seating and eating outside is always a huge treat."

The food was marvelous and the French menu was varied. The prices were reasonable. The wine was also fairly priced. The decor was lovely as was the clientele. Chez Joel is a romantic restaurant. It has a lovely outdoor area. which was where we dined. The wait staff were very professional and charming. The location is on Taylor Street. We highly recommend Chez Joel.

Chez Joel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g35805-d428852-Reviews-Chez_Joel-Chicago_Illinois.html,20-Dec-19,2,"Second chance, bad mistake.","We had been in CJ, several times, years ago. We used to drive all the way from the suburbs, until we found the steak tough. Year and a half ago, we moved to the city. Last night, we decided to give it another chance. What a disappointment! My husband's appetizer, the escargot, were delicious. My octopus, one of the specials of the day, was rubbery. My husband's steak frutas was grilled to a perfect medium rare but a tough piece of meat. My sea scallops were nicely presented but were lukewarm, at the most and in need of a little more searing. The waitress was informed of our dissatisfaction. She responded that they do not get any complaints. Perhaps, we expect higher /better quality when we dine out!On the positive side, the ambiance is inviting and as we were celebrating our anniversary, they presented us with a complimentary glass of rose sparkling wine.Second chance, last one! Definitely do not recommend and will not be back."
Chez Joel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g35805-d428852-Reviews-Chez_Joel-Chicago_Illinois.html,23-Sep-19,5,The Real Deal,"Better food and service than many of the Parisian bistros we've visited over the years. Not trendy, not overly buzzing, but absolutely the real deal. Coq a Vin was superb, and the scallops were artfully presented. And everything was perfectly cooked and seasoned, presented with attentive but not fussy service. Approachable wine list is extensive, and priced at about half of the trendy places downtown. A truly lovely experience, particularly in the outside garden."
Chez Joel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g35805-d428852-Reviews-Chez_Joel-Chicago_Illinois.html,4-Aug-19,5,Enchanting and romantic french bistro with sumptuous Cuisine ,"I appreciate a restaurant with excellent, clean tasting food, a kind hearted attentive staff and a welcoming ambiance. Chez joel Bistro is a unique French restaurant that has now become my favorite place to spoil myself with decadent French food and a loving, playful vibe. Last week on July 27 I wanted to go somewhere special for my birthday and I had a craving for French food so I did my online research and found this elegant and welcoming gem. I told the hostess Amber over the phone that I was reserving a small table for one and that I was also celebrating my birthday. I arrived at 8pm and to my great delight I found out they have an outside patio with romantic lighting and plants. I asked if I could sit outside instead and she made that possible for me within just fifteen minutes. As I was seated all the servers and bus people worked smoothly as a friendly, unified and cohesive team. Agnes brought me a menu and made some suggestions after I inquired about their various appetizers. I chose the warm brie which I thoroughly enjoyed, the fresh beet salad and the escargot which was buttery and succulent. The crusty baked French bread is some of the best I've ever tasted and it went well with the escargot sauce. They then surprised me with a birthday dessert of ice cream and a candle and since I already ordered profiteroles it almost felt ""naughty"" but hey it's my birthday who diets on their birthday! I loved my meal so much that I returned twice more and enjoyed a dinner with a friend of mine yesterday where I ordered the sea scallops and delicious chocolate moose for dessert. This late afternoon I wanted to sit outside again and try their prix fix menu so I chose the French onion soup, seared salmon with vegetables and profiteroles again for dessert. Agnes was my server on all three visits and Gabriel did an excellent job bringing over plates and water if Agnes was too busy. This afternoon I met Carlitos and he gave me the names of the staff here who were so helpful and welcoming. If you love to spoil yourself and really relish and take your time in a true European atmosphere then you will truly appreciate the level of service, the comforting, beautiful setting and the succulent French cuisine. In my estimation this bistro is one of the very best restaurants I've come across for authentic French cuisine and positive vibes. Even if you just wish to come here for a few appetizers your experience here will be a positive one and I guarantee you will leave feeling satiate. "

While other new ""hot"" spots in a ""foodie"" city like ours strive to be a little more edgy and upscale to woo the crowd that hops from one new spot to another, Chez Joel stays on target and remains just about the best among bistros.Walking in, and if weather permits, dining in the outdoor patio, one thinks of being transported to any of the great Parisian bistros. The ambiance, service and food never disappoint.Our most recent visit, with another couple, was on a delightfully warm evening where we sat in the very French feeling outdoor patio.We dined very well, starting with a marvelous grilled calamari and a delicate, delicious baked brie that was accompanied by toast points on the delightfully arranged plate.We moved on to entrees of mild and wonderful roasted corvina, steak with Roquefort, scallops lightly browned and delicate, all surrounded by an amazing array of fresh seasonal vegetables and as ""French as it can be Coq au Vin"", tender, flavorful and beautifully presented.A last note on food. No matter what you order at Chez Joel, do not fail to order their pomme frittes. They are simply the best.We drank a red Bordeaux, slightly young but very well rounded and finished dinner with a Sauterne and a delicious crème brulee.For a French bistro that remains true to itself and one of the best, try Chez Joel."

I love all things French and always like to be reminded of my travels to France by visiting French restaurants here in the states. This charming and cute bistro hits the spot. The food is delivered beautifully, top notch and simply delicious. There were 8 of us, so many entrees, soups, salads, and desserts were ordered and delivered timely to our table by our attentive server Amber. We were in awe of our amazing meals. Even though I did not drink wine on this particular evening because I had to drive back to Indiana, the wine selection is very impressive. The ambiance of the restaurant is very simple and beautiful. We ate inside. However, the outdoor patio is beautiful and well manicured. There is Valet Parking and the restaurant is very easy to find on Taylor Street situated on a corner across from Busy Burger. The restaurant is also family friendly as well. We were dining with a 10 year old and 5 year old. My 5 year old niece was able to request her typical favorite (pasta) with any type of sauce. This is a great place for a romantic night, a special celebration or just to come and enjoy a wonderful french meal. I had the best dining experience here and will return soon!

Her favorite restaurant by far in Chicago and she goes there fairly often. Words cannot adequately describe the awesome experience had by all. When I approached Ahmed, the owner, he immediately embraced the idea and helped me plan the menu and every detail. Suggested an excellent florist in the area (Jazzy Flowers). Every detail was looked after impeccably. It was a beautiful afternoon so we decided to set up in the charming patio area. It looked wonderful. Ahmed printed out menus which appeared under each napkin. We arrived, had excellent red and white wines (chosen by them), and then sat down to uniformly wonderful dishes, one after another. The servers were friendly, accommodating, and so helpful. So perfect, can't say enough. Central location to all areas of Chicago. Would highly recommend for excellent food and the friendliest, personal touches."

We came for a lunch in continuation of a birthday celebration. We arrived about 1 p.m., so there were only a few people left after any lunch crowd. We were seated immediately and chose the private patio, as it was a beautiful warm day. Our server, Agnes, was there immediately with warm bread. We started off with the escargot appetizer - delicious! And the bread was great for dipping in the escargot garlic butter after you ate the escargot. Because we ordered from the fixed price lunch we chose a French onion soup and a bowl of lobster bisque (it looked like a huge bowl). For some reason we chose the same entree, the filet mignon de bœuf grillé au jus de cuisson which is filet mignon grilled in a thyme au jus, mushroom fricassee, a mound of white rice mixed with corn and haricots verts (green beans). The meat was tender and the sauce was great. On our two plates, there were actually four different colored carrot slices - including purple. We each chose a dessert - a profiterole and a creme brulee. Agnes, our server, was personable and quite attentive. The prices were reasonable."

We thought we would try Chez Joel for dinner on a ""date night"", and it was great. The ambiance is wonderful. It was not noisy and when we were there, it was not completely full. I will say that by the time we left - we were completely full, however. So, when in France... We first ordered the French Onion soup - Soupe à l'Oignon Gratinée. Then we ordered the hot frog leg appetizer - Cuisses de Grenouilles à la Provençale. (I miss those from Phil Smidt's in Whiting, In.) For an entree, we ordered the filet mignon grilled in a thyme au jus, mushroom fricassee, mashed potatoes and haricots verts - Filet Mignon de Bœuf Grillé Au Jus De Cuisson. Everything tasted great. The meat was tender and the sauce was out of this world. The service was impeccable and the prices were reasonable for the type and quality of the food. It was especially nice to dine in a restaurant at the east end of ""Little Italy"" that didn't have students in it."

Both were superb; the endive salad has Roquefort cheese and apple strips to soften the endive bitterness. Generous salmon portion (I took a picture).I had a special ""steak Rossi"" a 6 oz filet with roasted pear on top. Just over the top good (took a picture of that, too). Our friends had a whitefish special that came with Brussels sprouts which he generously donated to my wife and me. The last entree was a Chez Joel mainstay duck (canard) with orange sauce, plus a calamari appetizers. Both were very good. We splurged and got pommes frites for the table. Our waitress Amber was perfect, neither obtrusive nor absent. Empty plates and cutlery were promptly removed; water glasses were kept filled.

The food was delicious! Our party of four had different entrees from fish to duck to steak and all reported their selections were fantastic! The salads were fresh and good sized. Of course, the desserts were awesome! The valet parking made it very easy, too."
Chez Joel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g35805-d428852-Reviews-Chez_Joel-Chicago_Illinois.html,16-Oct-16,4,A joyous visit to Chez Joel,"A small and super charming French restaurant in the heart of Little Italy, Chez Joel is just a joy. And the food is great.Chez Joel is a white tablecloth eatery, but it feels very casual and welcoming -- the opposite of stuffy. The staff is friendly and helpful and they know the menu inside and out and are happy to offer suggestions and accommodate special requests. We were a large crowd -- there were nine of us -- but each of us was treated as if he or she were the only diner in the place. That's how attentive the staff was. I think the standout entrees of the evening were classically French dishes -- my husband's Coq au Vin -- the chicken was braised in white wine rather than the traditional red -- and my friend's hefty portion of bouillabaisse which was chock full of fish and shellfish in a light broth.Because the servings were so generous, we had to skip dessert.We loved Chez Joel and recommend it for a relaxing, laid-back -- and filling -- dinner. Great wine list, too."
Chez Joel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g35805-d428852-Reviews-Chez_Joel-Chicago_Illinois.html,4-Oct-16,5,Consistent excellence ,"I'm not sure how they do it. We have been coming here for years, and although the menu doesn't change much, nor is it the most extensive, the food is exactly as expected time after time. The pâtés are superb, as are the escargots. You can never go wrong with the duck and steak frites, steak au poivre and salmon entrees. The garden seating area is great for summer al fresco dining. Listen to the specials before you order though. There is something compelling enough on the specials list that every time we visit, at least one person in our party chooses at least one special item in place of an old favorites on the regular menu. Excellent ingredients, perfectly prepared, every time, no bad surprises. Many restaurants strive to achieve this consistency but few pull it off. Chez Joel is one of the few. "

The atmosphere? The staff?No matter where you begin, you'll end with a happy stomach and a smile on your face.Nestled in the brimming University area, Chez Joel is a place easily overlooked, but once you find it, you'll never forget it.We had a lovely dinner before a concert and from the initial greeting to the final morsel, the evening was perfect. The food was simply amazing. The wine list perfectly paired. The staff attentive but unobtrusive.

But, it's French and so very very good.They have a lunch special for $22: soup, main course and dessert. I'd be happy just to eat their bread and butter.Last time there I had onion soup, a beef stew and profiteroles for dessert. My friend had some sort of ham sandwich and lots of those skinny fries. For the first time, the service was not good...very slow. Maybe some staff called in sick. I don't know but I forgave them because loved what they served us!Hard to park there but they have free valet parking."

Since we were somewhat west I suggested a return visit to Che JOEL. We were lucky and able to get a table by calling ahead. This was our third visit and had the opportunity to sit outside in a lively bugless garden. My wife and I shared the very special turnips and fennel soup, smoked salmon and the mushroom risotto. Everything was fantastic , including the bill. This was authentic French food in a marvelous ambience with affordable pricing. We had great service from Agnes and Irena .

The paté appetiser was excellent although the grilled octopus was a little tough. The wine list is adequate AND is very reasonably priced. Although the restaurant was full, (thunderstorms meant that the patio was closed), the service was good, - competent without being overly solicitous. My lamb shanks were good but not exceptional, the sea bass was excellent but the coq au vin was somewhat lacking."

As I do not drink or eat anything containing alcohol I checked with our server who said he was sorry but it contained pernot and it was not possible to provide it without the alcohol. I then asked about the duck - sorry the sauce contains alcohol you would have to have it without the sauce! The special fish of the day also contained alcohol and could not be altered. So then i asked what on the menu could i eat? Well probably the steak frites , the chef salad or the ravioli. and the chef salad had a dressing containing alcohol so that it would have to be vinaigrette dressing. At this stage I almost walked out, there was no attempt to accommodate my request and the waiter seemed put out that I would want something a little different from what was on the menu. I really cannot understand why a different sauce could not be provided for the duck or pernod not added to the bouillabaisse - unless the sauces are prepared well in advance and reheated just before serving.One of my friends is vegetarian and also ended up with the (very) small chef saladThe garden is lovely and secluded but I will not be going back somewhere I was made to feel very uncomfortable and unwanted.I went home and made a cheese sandwich - I was so hungry."

This visit was average. It started out well -- the restaurant gave us last minute seating, at the bar. It is a tight fit; some might say quaint. The cocktails -- a Saint Honore and Kir Royal -- were overmixed. We asked for some additional bubbly to help dilute the liqueur, but that did not help. The ratatouille was the highlight; the escargot was pretty good, but the moules marinieres and epinards a l'ail were below average. The service was quick, which we needed and appreciated, as we had an event that evening."

Entree and dessert. Multiple options for each category. French onion soup for each of us. Feel obligated to order this pretty much anywhere I find it. Then the steak Roquefort for me and salmon for my wife. Creme brûlée and profiteroles. And we started with some brie and apricots. I mention it all because it was all worth mentioning. Food was all great. Amber took very good care of us she was friendly and gave advice when asked. Perfect. It's evenings like this that only make us want to get out more often. Thanks Chez Joel.

Everything that I remembered was the same and even better. The salad with tomatos, onions and blue cheese was divine. The smoked salmon and French onion soup were great starters. The house special risotto with mushrooms was spectacular and all topped off with a chocolate bomb for dessert. Liquor prices are not outrageous and the restaurant provides a very warmsetting , where one can enjoy a delectable dinner. This is a great place for normal dining as well as for foodies.

It's located near Little Italy, and they have valet parking which is a plus for the area. We sat next to the window, it was a great view. It's cozy, dimly lit, and for being completely packed, we were able to carry on a conversation without yelling. Service was really top notch, it honestly could not have been better. Our waiter was friendly, helpful, and really made the evening even better. We had an amazing bottle of wine, which was reasonably priced (he did mention they have deals if you're buying more than one). We had French onion soup which was freshly prepared with broiled cheese melted over the sides, but it honestly needed more salt.. and we're not particularly salt people. We had two orders of escargot, which were good, but definitely not the best we've ever had. For entrees, we had lamb, duck, and two fish specials. The plating was wonderful, very nice touches, and each plate was perfectly cooked and delicious. The entrée sizes were also substantial. We really enjoyed this meal. The only negative I can say about this restaurant was that the women's lavatory was out of order, and the men's was absolutely horrid. However, the entrees were absolutely wonderful and we really enjoyed the service and atmosphere. We will definitely return."

We went here this week and ordered off the restaurant week menu which was a really great deal! The meal started off some great wine (there were tons to choose from)! The first course was delicious with the soup of the day (mushroom) and escargot. Definitely recommend both of those! Second course we ordered the salmon and steak with frites. The salmon and it's sauce were superb, but the steak was overcooked and tough. Dessert course was also incredible, including the cocktails we ordered. One of the best creme brûlée I've had and the mousse was great too! Everything was amazing (minus the steak, which was disappointing)."

We went for lunch and the place was more or less empty. That gave us a bit of scare but well, some reviews were good. I chose a poulet aux champignons and was served without the jasmine rice which was noted on menu. My wife took the crab cake special and they forgot the fingerling potatoes. Plus the taste of everything was sub-par. I guess the owner was also wandering around but never bothered to greet or ensure the food quality. Adding to it we had a housefly wandering about the table constantly. So, maybe they had a bad day but for me as a customer, it will take a lot of convincing for me to set foot at Chez Joel again....what a waste of 100+ dollars!! :("

We were fine at our table until the one next to us got occupied and their chairs rammed against ours as they sat.Waiters arre friendly and helpful.The food is average. Food was nicely presented, but I did not care much for their deep bowls dinnerware in which they served our soup, salad and dessert? Same style dinnerware for three types of food. It was kind of odd. But more than odd it was not practical for the items served in them apart from the soup.The taste of the food was nothing special. We ordered the fish main dishes, salmon and bass which was catch of the day. Bass did not taste fresh at all , and in was very oily. Did not like the way it was prepared. The profiterole dessert was stale. And as far as I know proper profiterole should not be stuffed with ice cream as this one was.Al in all, it was a nice experience for the ambience. But the food was not really something I would like to try again."

I started going to Chez Joel when I would visit him, and leaving late (say 8:30 to 10:00pm) looking for somewhere to eat. I've eaten there 4 times over 2.5 years, and every time it was fantastic. When he obtained his Masters degree we went there for our celebratory dinner.The staff is always first rate. From the valet to the host to the wait staff and the bus service everyone is well trained and does their job excellently. The menu is not long - but everything on it is great. From cassoullet to steak and seafood, it has all been great. Appetizers, salads and desserts done quite nicely. Cocktails done perfectly for about $12.50 - which is below market for much of Chicago. The wine list - again short - but very approachable; with good French wines and none expensive. Very good wine from mid-$30 to $50/bottle. Excellent Chateneuff-de-pape for $70. And a good Sauterne after the meal for $39. So very, very affordable wines.When it is just 2 of us eating late we usually have an appetizer or salad and entree and split both. If hungry we have either appetizer+salad+entree and split all, or we have salad+entree+dessert. Expect starters and salads in range of $10-$15. Entrees mostly $20-30. Deserts $10. So not badly priced at all.For my son's celebration we ate at 6:30. 2 of us arrived 15 minutes early, and were seated immediately. Ordered a cocktail. The other 2 were 15 minutes late - but never one sense of concern by the restaurant. We had a blowout meal with cocktails, 2 bottles of wine, sauterne, dessert - and with tip whole thing for about $120/person. A great meal for a really remarkably good price.The atmosphere is great. Small bar, seats maybe 10. I've seen people eat at the bar. Small restaurant, sized actually like a restaurant in Paris. Small tables, which makes it intimate. Not too noisy, it is quite easy to have a great conversation - and you don't find yourself listening to (or shouting over) nearby tables. Very attractively put together.I've been very impressed. I live in the far northwest Chicago suburbs, but really enjoy eating here and intend to do so more often. A great meal, at a great value."

It is charming and intimate with nicely prepared dishes with French touches. The service was attentive and caring--no waiting even during busy Valentine's Day, and no rushing you along--so you can talk and have a relaxed meal. We sat in the window and enjoyed French Martinis, onion soup, salad with figs, rack of lamb, filet mignon, all carefully prepared.

They offered my wife and I space at their small zinc topped bar. The room was pleasantly full of people with thankfully a very low sound level which made conversations easy to conduct.The bartender did a fine job of serving us. She knew the menu and could answer questions. The meal was paced well and service was efficient and unobtrusive.The menu was classic french bistro and heavy on steaks. The soups included a very nice French onion which we enjoyed. The salads were well designed and executed.

In the summer, there are French doors that open up onto Taylor Street and they have a beautiful hidden patio where you can dine al fresco, complete with garden and running fountain.Their menu is somewhat limited but what they do, they do incredibly well. The pate, mussels, escargot and scallops are our go-to appetizers. Their main courses are always excellent, especially the filet mignon. We also love the Coq Au Vin and Linguine aux Fruits de Mer. Their fish specials are always delicious - salmon, white fish, etc. They make great cocktails and have a very nice, mostly French, wine list.The service is exceptional - everyone from the bus boys, the servers and the owner, Ahmed.

The atmosphere is inviting but quite plain, the menu is great French fare always offering Steak Frites which is outstanding and such a French classic. They offer several specials every night but the menu has a nice variety of standard fare. The seafood salad is exceptional and a nice size, especially if you love the escargot and want something light to follow. The risotto last evening was with asparagus and sautéed Portobello mushrooms but seemed to heavy to pair it with the inviting escargots! If you haven't been, this restaurant is a MUST for everyone who likes French fare and a place quiet enough to enjoy company and actually converse."

Service and food were outstanding. The menu is limited but covers most French staples. The place is small and feels special without being stuffy or intimidating. Great for those new to French cuisine as well as the more experienced. It is located on Taylor street in the University Village/Tri-Taylor neighborhood, just 15 minutes from downtown Chicago. This is a historic Chicago neighborhood. In warm weather months you can find great Italian ice just down the street at Mario's Italian Lemonade. There are a few bars for a night cap a few minutes away on Halsted street."

Highly recommended, it's a small spot so you will probably need a reservation. Food and service was excellent. I had a salad and my husband had the escargot appetizer, we were both raving about the quality and presentation. The I had the rack of NZ lamb special and my husband had the filet mignon. Again, knocked it out of the park - the lamb was the best I have had in a very long time. Service was outstanding to the point my husband commented on how many service staff they have. There was a small issue with my salad (goat cheese was forgotten) but that was corrected in seconds when I pointed it out. I found the pricing really reasonable for the value and I have paid much more in Chicago for much less quality fare. Highly recommend this restaurant."
Chez Joel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g35805-d428852-Reviews-Chez_Joel-Chicago_Illinois.html,17-Mar-13,4,Charming and Fun,"Went here with a lady friend for a special night out. A bit off the beaten path, but it was worth the trip. Chez Joel is a very small, quaint retaurant, with charming decor - we both loved the chandelier in the dining room, and the Toulouse-Lautrec prints on the walls. The menu was a bit limited, but adequate. We shared two appetizers: the Pate de Deux Sortes and the Wild Mushroom Quiche. The pate was outstanding, the quiche so-so. For our entrees, we both had filet mignon, but prepared in two different ways. My date had the standard menu version with Sauce Bordeaulaise, and I had the special, with foie gras and port wine sauce. Both were excellent, and prepared to the proper degree of doneness. The desserts were good as well. Our server was adequate, but seemed as though she wished she were somewhere else. Chez Joel allows you to bring your own wine for a $25 corkage fee, which is a big plus with me, but their wine list is pretty good, and reasonably priced. All in all, it was a very pleasant experience, and I would definitely go back."

We knew that going in so it wasn't a problem. If you are expecting large menu with a lot of french staples you will be disappointed. Cheese plate and appetizer were excellent. We both ordered steak for an entree. Both were cooked exactly as we ordered. They were good but it wasn't the greatest beef. If you've ever been to Mon ami gabi it was similar quality if a bit lower. Service/AmbianceService was excellent. Not hovering but right there if you needed something. Restaurant was very cute reminiscent of a proper french bistro.
Chez Joel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g35805-d428852-Reviews-Chez_Joel-Chicago_Illinois.html,2-Feb-13,4,A little pricey,"Editing my previous review from the last time we went. We just returned to Chez Joel and found that prices had substantially increased. The food is still good, but not quite as we would be expecting for $130 for 2 persons. Appetizers were good but not great (snails / baby octopus). The Chilean bass fish was good but not worth $30 for the dish (not on the regular menu, and of course we didn't know the price until we got the check). Service was a bit overwhelming and we felt that we were rushed so that our table could get freed up for the next customers (on a Saturday night). It's a shame that what used to be our favorite restaurant went down a grade."
Chez Joel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g35805-d428852-Reviews-Chez_Joel-Chicago_Illinois.html,11-Dec-12,5,France in Little Italy,"My wife and I have been dining at Chez Joel for years , and have never been disappointed. The food the service are always top notch. The appetizers , especially the pate , are delicious. The steaks are wonderful and they always have a fish special on the menu. I usually start with the scallops in a beur blanc sauce with caramelized leeks. For an entree I love the beef tenderloin , which never disappoints. Fish specials include salmon , skate or striped bass and are always done to perfection. I'm really not an oenophile but I do enjoy the wine selection. All in all I don't think you can go wrong dining at Chez Joel. An added plus is the out door dining area which is open during certain times of the year. Kudos to every one connected with this wonderful restaurant."

We got the bananas foster french toast, the cinnamon french toast, eggs and potatoes.  The bananas foster was so decadent.  Warning - their french toast is fried. So it’s definitely delicious but, with 7 types of sugar making it up, this is dessert not breakfast. Lol. Which is why I felt the need to order us eggs as well. We were on vacation though so enjoyed it.  The bananas french toast came with vanilla gelato too  (a new one for me)   Good location off Michigan ave and nice sitting outside.More"

So fresh and delicious. The veal bracciole was two pieces served with home made cavatelli.in a tomato sauce that was not too sweet. The chunky bolognese penne was fresh and well seasoned.

Under cooked and hard to cut with a steak knife.  We also shared escarole and beans, which looked like it had been sitting around for a long time.  Very mushy.  I had good old penne and red sauce.

We had an excellent bottle of wine from the Lange region of Italy which accompanied our meal nicely.  We then had individual meals and they were very very large. Perhaps they plan on you taking enough home for the next 2 days.

There were three really large Scampi so we each had one as an appetizer.  At $21 it is a decent value.  I had the Bolognese with a side of Italian Sausage and both were delicious and really large.  At ~ $31 for the two its a bit pricey but either could have fed me.

Have always wanted to try it but never worked out - until last night. A family member told us the Taylor Street location was the best, so we went there. The staff was experienced and friendly - enjoyable. The venue itself is also nice. From those aspects I was not disappointed. Fire the chef and the entire kitchen staff. Seriously. Portion sizes are large, but not good enough to be motivated to finish. Our calamari appetizer, while crispy on the outside, was raw inside. My wife’s veal parmigiana, the entree by which she compares all Italian restaurants, was indescribably horrible. One of the special entrees was a “veal chop”, my entree of comparison for Italian restaurants. What came to the table was a tasteless veal chop parmigiana - not my favorite, classic, veal chop that I thought I had ordered. Neither of us ate more than 1/4 to 1/2 of our entrees. All day today we’ve several times discussed how terrible our dinner was. I only write bad reviews when warranted and I’m the first to offer up good reviews when earned. Rosebud on Taylor is off my list, no second chance, will never go back, and will never recommend. There are too many great Italian restaurants in Chicago. "

We loved how the shuttle driver from our hotel walked us into the restaurant and introduced us to the staff! They were very animated and excited to see each other and it set a fun and welcoming tone for our visit! We started with a special appetizer of stuffed zucchini blossoms, which were perfectly fried and flavorful. I had perhaps the best vodka dirty martini I have ever ordered (compete with a second skewer of olives). There were several specials that night (a Saturday) in addition to the traditional Italian fare on the menu. I ordered the filet, which was cooked perfectly, but could have been more flavorful. The sides are a separate charge and are served family style, so be sure to ask your dining companions if they would share if ordered. My sister had a veal dish that she said was excellent and my spouse had the rigatoni, which was delicious. The sauce was a little sweeter than I usually like, but it worked with the richness of the cheese. If you can save room, their tiramisu was wonderful.I am rating this five stars primarily for the wonderful and attentive staff! The food was delicious, but the experience made the meal."

I was in town for business this week and decided to see if things had changed. I am happy to say they have not. Rosebud has always been known for large portions of well-seasoned Italian classics. I started with a good Caesar salad with real anchovies. Nobody uses anchovies any more. I had the baked ziti which was really good. I could not eat more than half. We sat outside because it was a beautiful evening. I did go inside to use the washroom and the place was as I remembered it. Kind of dark and clubby. Maybe a bit dated but very comfortable.

No lineup when we arrived (but I do suggest making reservations, especially on weekends) so my family and I were seated immediately. We had requested in the reservation to sit at the table with Frank Sinatra’s picture but it was unavailable, however we were seated to the table right next to it which was the next best thing. The atmosphere is one of the best things about this place, the décor is classic, lovely, relaxed and has an old world charm that makes you feel like you’ve gone back in time. There is a chandelier that looks like it’s from the 40’s and lovely artwork. The food was fantastic and the portions are family sized so we picked out in advance what we wanted to order. We started off with the Cesar salad which was enough to serve 3 people to have as a side plate and was fresh and full of garlic. For the entrée my daughter and I each had the veal parmesan (she had been wanting it since she watched the godfather a week before) and was the one of the best we both have ever tasted! It was mouthwatering, tasty and a generous portion size (could be split for 2) The Veal came with a small pasta bowl with tomato sauce on top. My husband had the lasagna and the table shared a plate of garlic bread which wasn’t as good as I thought it would be. For dessert we shared a piece of chocolate cake which was satisfactory but next time I think I’ll try the cannoli’s. Service was excellent despite it being a busy Saturday night. Our server was accommodating and attentive. The only downside was that we had to wait over half an hour for a cab to come despite the restaurant phoning twice. Other than that we will continue to comeback whenever we are in Chicago."

Patrick had always been our waiter and we thoroughly enjoyed his demeanor and service. He always had time for light banter, good food recommendations and his service/promptness was commendable. Unfortunately, I cannot give a positive review of our new waiter. Service was very slow even with only a couple of dining tables occupied. Water glasses were not refilled and the bus boy hovered over us during appetizers like he was trying to listen to our conversation. Food was definitely not as good as on previous visits. Two pasta dishes were mediocre and lacking in taste and the special, lamb Osso Bucco $55, had little meat on the shank and bucket of sauce. Very unappetizing! There are many very good Italian restaurants in Chicago and I think our group will not return to The Rosebud."

For starters, when we arrived at 5:55 for our 6:00 reservations we had to wait about 10 minutes for a table. However, two couples that arrived after us were seated first because and even though they were actually extremely late (one reservation was 5:30 and one was 5:45). So I guess it's not first come, first seat here; if you're late you get rewarded by skipping the wait and line to be seated immediately. We mostly really liked and enjoyed the ambiance such as the decor and dim lighting, but the noise level was pretty insane and hard to have a conversation. The bread was hot and fresh; we always love the oil and parmesean cheese to mix with the bread. My husband ordered the stuffed pork chop, which he said was delicious. I ordered the 12 ounce filet mignon and asked for it to be cooked medium well. After eating a few bites, it became clear it was cooked more medium rare to rare; it was extremely pink and bloody. I asked the waiter to return it to be cooked longer. It arrived back completely charred and cooked well done, or as my husband described it when it hit the table ""it looks like a hockey puck"" and said we could bring it to the United Center with us they can use it. Needless to say, I did not enjoy my $50 plus meal at all. Since there are so many other varied menu items, I would be willing to try again in the future, but next time will order something completely different such as a delicious Italian pasta dish and hope for better luck. I will say the wait staff was excellent; amicable and always had our drinks filled before we had to be the first to ask/request them. Also, the valet parking (which cost $10) attendants were quick to retrieve the vehicle afterward, which was much appreciated."

How about pasta, veal, chicken, ribs, seafood, steaks or chops? Did we miss anything? Rosebud has an old world atmosphere and an old world flavor. For starters, my wife and I had bruschetta, minestrone and Caesar salad. But it was tougher to decide on an entree with so many tempting options. My wife finally settled on Norwegian salmon or Lake Superior whitefish and veal Saltimbocca and meat ravioli. I chose veal parmesan over spaghetti and meatballs and a 10-ounce filet mignon and Taylor Street BBQ ribs and the Original Rosebud chicken bone-in Vesuvius. The choice of dessert wasn't so daunting.

In Chicago’s little Italy there’s just such a place. The Rosebud is one of these places if you’re looking for good Italian food in an Italian atmosphere. The bruschetta was a fun, tasty start with us ordering cannelloni, spaghetti with meatballs, veal, and pasta with meat sauce. All were great. The salads were great too.

Given that it was one of two restaurants we dined at while visiting Chicago I'm sorry we wasted the opportunity to try something else. The saving grace was that we could eat outside, which was great in the warm weather, and our waiter, who was fantastic. The bread was okay, the cocktails okay, the stuffed artichoke HORRIBLE with bland bread crumb stuffing floating in a non-descript sauce, the veal actually good (I had francese) and the cannoli mediocre with something added to the ricotta filling to ""extend"" it. All in all, I would recommend skipping this and trying something better in town."

I was here for a large late night party and it was beautifully handled. One person raved about their lasagne and my sea bass was perfect. Unfortunately, I ordered the panzanella salad to start and it was really an entree salad, not a starter. It was unlike any panzanella I’ve ever had; basically it was the house salad with bread added.

I had the baked clams, which were fantastic; the Italian Wedding soup, which was good, but a little salty; and the Tortellini Carbonara, which was killer. We also shared the chopped salad, which has a little bit of everything from chunks of Mozzarella to corn to beets. Salads are large. One salad (~$16) was enough for 4 of us to each have some. The meatballs (available in entrees or on the side) are fantastic! Seasoned and flavorful--don't miss them!"

I have to say that I was disappointed in the food and the service. Our waiter started out ok but when I asked if I could have pasta instead of potatoes with my salmon Vesuvio, he said he would bring grilled salmon and pasta, but that it wasn't appropriate to have pasta with the special salmon. The dish itself was just okay, and I didn't like the potatoes at all. My friends liked their choices, and I tried the simple penne with vodka sauce, which was tasty. Overall, I wouldn't go back before trying many other spots in the city. "

This year we went to a competitor's for dinner both nights. The reason for this is because the competitor's staff treats you like they value your business. Rosebud used to but this year was horrible. Marco treated us horribly, even flipped us off! Yes, he actually gave us the finger. We will never go back to Rosebud, esp. after being treated like trash and being treated like gold at another place."

I recently had the mussel appetizer at lunch. It was spectacular. Huge plump succulent morsels in a tasty tomato sauce with great garlic bread turned out to be two meals for me. In previous visits I have enjoyed the wonderful lobster ravioli and chicken vesuvio as well. The only reason I give it four stars is that on occasion I have attended parties at this location wherein not all of the dishes measured up to a five star rating.

We were not disappointed. We stopped mid-afternoon on a weekday, so they were not too busy. We were seated immediately and had a hard time choosing from the variety of choices on the menu. We settled on the chicken parmesan, (which we split) and the stuffed mushroom appetizers. Loved the casual atmosphere and the old school décor. When our food arrived, we discovered the portion size was more than enough for the 2 of us, even when splitting a meal. The mushroom appetizer was a great treat and the chicken parm was delicious. Probably the best we've had in a long time. I wish I could have remembered our waiter's name because he was excellent. I would come back again just for the excellent service he gave. Prices were not bad, especially when you consider the large portion size. All in all, this was a great dining experience. Next time we're in Chicago, we will definitely make the trip back to The Rosebud."

Still solid Italian cuisine. Dined with family. Casual atmosphere, excellent service, friendly wait staff. A large number of menu choices. Wine selection was modest. The sausage and peppers was Classic and as good as I remember. The fried calamari was perfectly seasoned, fresh, and deep fried. The Tortellini Carbonara was very nice. The Rigatoni alla Vodka was very good. The Prime Skirt Steak was perfectly seasoned and prepared. Overall a great dining experience."

We ordered a Caesar salad and lasagna, and we decided to split it, as we really don't like to stuff ourselves and were trying to save ourselves for some Italian ice from down the street, or quite possibly, a cannoli from across the street at Pompeii. We thought it seemed a bit overpriced and the food was very good, but not out of this world."
The Rosebud,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g35805-d428856-Reviews-The_Rosebud-Chicago_Illinois.html,24-Apr-17,4,A classic all the way,"Visited the original Rosebud on Taylor Street after a Chicago Bulls game. (It's about an eight block walk from the stadium.) Neither of us had been there for years so we were really visiting based on it's reputation vs what we knew of it today.We were very pleased with everything. First off, our server Erin was attentive, friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. It was late so we decide to share two entrees - our first course was of course pasta - a gluten-free penne with Bolognese sauce - DELICIOUS!!! Gluten-free pasts is difficult to cook so I was pleased it turned out so well and my friend couldn't tell the difference! (note: gluten-free pasta usually has a high glycemic index).Our second course was the Original Rosebud (bone-in) Chicken - we opted for the Italiano style. The chicken and sauce were just great. I wasn't overly impressed with the potatoes (I'm super picky about potatoes) but still quite edible. Overall worth the wait (hence why we had a first course of pasta as this takes about 30-35 minutes as it's cooked to order). The wine list was extensive and varied with bottles starting around circa $40 and going up for there - quite reasonable considering a glass of wine in the nearby Loop will cost at least $15.Last but not least was dessert. We chose spumoni. It's been a long time since I've had spumoni and it was a real delight. If you're a desert person The Rosebud chain has their own commissary where deserts are made for all their restaurants. Alas I can't have them but they looked fantastic. And the spumoni was an excellent choice for something lighter. Overall - there's a reason why The Rosebud has been a staple in the landscape of Chicago's Little Italy for decades."

Stopped in for a simple but above average dinner. Started with a superior order of mussels in their lovely tomato broth. Just fabulous! A generous pile of plump fresh mussels in a delicious broth with stewed tomatoes and garnish that was out of this world. In the mood for some salad, we shared the house salad, which was crisp and refreshing mixed lettuce, grape tomato, cucumber with a light traditional oil/vinegar dressing. Perfect. Our main course was a broiled sea bass under a plum tomato red wine reduction with a side of sautéed spinach, which was another masterpiece. For dessert, the decadent Godiva chocolate mousse cake. A glass of Montepulciano, a glass of Chardonnay, and we were done. Such a splendid dinner made of the freshest ingredients. The only thing short of 5 full stars was the atmosphere, and the clientele. Paper table covering had me wary of paper cuts. The decor was forgettable. And since when do people go out for dinner in TShirts, hoodies and ball caps? The waitstaff was decked out in proper attire, serving slobs."

It's bigger on the inside than the outside suggests. If you can get a corner or a booth, take it, Was kind of awkward sitting at a table out in the middle of the floor somewhat.Okey, now time for the grub.1==Linguini in garlic & oil with the shrimp...A KEEPER!! The shrimps might as well be prawns because they were almost that big. They will take you over the edge!! If you ask for them to load it up with shrimp they don't charge much more. They give you a decent amount but if you just gotta have more it's not bad. They have the broccoli in the pasta and the broccoli is THE TRUTH!!! Not wilted, not mushy. Don't know what they did to it, but it had a little crunch to it and seasoned JUST RIGHT so it doesn't overtake the pasta.But once you taste these large shrimp, you might just want them as an entree alone with a side of the linguini.2==Sausage & peppers. They don't skimp on anything. I believe this is why they STAY busy.I don't know what planet they get those mini snausages from but cut up with the peppers is the stuff.3==Grilled/steamed veggies. They were ok, nothing I'd cheer for. But I don't like squash so since it was part of the veggie tray, it was a turn off for me. But they had ALL the broccoli in there, stem and everything. Now that I DID like. 4==Caesar salad. The croutons said it all. I'm used to a lot of shaved cheese in caesar salads from other places. This was extra fine shredded, couldn't see it but could taste it a little. They had no problems in giving an extra bowl no charge.5==Cookies...Naw, leave those alone. They had some chocolate/white chocolate covered somethings that tasted ok. I'm not a dessert person in this place...got spoiled by the shrimpRating from 1-5: MAJOR 5!! Wouldn't hesitate to eat, but remember, the food is NOT cheap. I'd say range is $$ to $$$$."
The Rosebud,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g35805-d428856-Reviews-The_Rosebud-Chicago_Illinois.html,23-Jan-17,5,"After you've been there, you've got to go back","If you're an aficionado of traditional Italian cuisine, if you adore bruschetta, spaghetti and meatballs, lasagna, veal scallopine, veal saltimbocca, chicken Vesuvio, ravioli, fettuccine, rigatoni, linguine, manicotti and tiramisu, then you're a fan of The Rosebud at 1500 West Taylor Street in Chicago's Little Italy neighborhood. It is the original Rosebud, founded 40 years ago by legendary Chicago restauranteur Alex Dana. Today, the Rosebud Restaurant Group has established several locations in the Chicago area, from Carmine's to Rosebud on Rush, from Rosebud Prime to Rosebud Steakhouse. But the West Taylor address is where it all began. And if you covet traditional Italian fare, you are persuaded to go back, again and again. I wasn't born into an Italian family but I can imagine that the home-style cooking and family atmosphere that you experience in this old-fashioned restaurant is just what Alex Dana envisioned when he launched his enterprise. My wife and I are traditionalists so our order resembled an A-B-C of Italian eating...bruschetta, minestrone, Caesar salad, veal Saltimbocca, spaghetti and meatballs, tiramisu. You order Italian in an Italian restaurant, right? Like ordering steak in a steakhouse and fish in a seafood restaurant. At Rosebud, however, the original chicken Vesuvio and meat ravioli and baked lasagna and Norwegian salmon and whitefish and BBQ ribs and 8-ounce filet and 15-ounce New York strip are tasty alternatives. But the original Rosebud started a trend that many restaurants have followed over the years. Good service and good food always make for a winning combination."

They just moved in not too far away. My son says I don't like pizza and red sauce. I say you don't know Italian food. First course, calamari calabrese, best I have ever had. I ask my server what he recommends, he says bone in ribeye encrusted in garlic. I say where is that on the menu, oh, it's not. I am now in the insiders club. My ribeye, to die for. I am a chef, these words do not come out of my mouth often. This is the best of the best, probably prime, with a perfect char, oh and did I mention it doesn't appear anywhere on the menu. The food is beautiful, for me the sense of time and place and history is beautiful too. But the kids, they want to spend hours in a line for the latest trendy chefs carnival take on food. Let me make a strawberry taste like a tomato BS. I fear that as this generation of restaranteaur and server ages and dies off, this form of dining will as well, and we will all be lost, reminiscing about the statelyness of white table cloths and how the dining experience was about them serving you and not you worshipping them. Go to this place. Experience this. Eat too much. Take 2 hours to really do it. And know that this is what it should be. A true dining experience."

They try to charge the account in cash because they show me that my credits cards didn´t work but after to try 5 differents!! they accept one of themThis type of thing probably works in the past but not today. I don´t think come back to this restaurant, there is a lot and good in Chicago"
The Rosebud,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g35805-d428856-Reviews-The_Rosebud-Chicago_Illinois.html,1-Jan-17,5,Great food and service,"We have been going to Rosebud on Taylor for several years. The food is very good and service wonderful. Lasagne, chicken piccata (melt in your mouth), wedding soup, calamari. You are able to order your pasta and style of sauce as their food is made from scratch. I ordered lasagne with arrabbiata sauce, wonderful! I'd go on but you can check out their menu online! Excellent wine choices to pair with your meal. Beautiful restaurant that will take you to another time in this world. I love the music and ambiance. Valet parking as you pull up to the front door. Lunch time parking is free (don't forget to tip), dinner time parking there is a $10 charge. But your vehicle is next door in their lot and no worries of receiving a ticket.My rating of not appropriate for children is regarding no children's menu. Toddlers and children needing a high chair would not enjoy the setting of this restaurant. Go and enjoy a wonderful experience."

The Rosebud,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g35805-d428856-Reviews-The_Rosebud-Chicago_Illinois.html,18-Dec-16,3,"Good food, but there is much better","Went here with a large group (16) of people over the Weekend. Honestly it was more of a let down than anything. The food was good, but much of it is overpriced for what you get and the service was terrible. We sat down and it took a long time to get drink orders. No big deal, but we then got only two baskets of bread for 16 people. It took 5 different people asking before we finally got one more basket. Water cups were rarely refilled with asking multiple times, other drink refills were nonexistent, and the food took forever to come out. Once we got the food our server disappeared. Like I said above, most of the food was good, but be careful about ordering the specials. They are all priced very high ($45 when we were there) regardless of what they were (a pasta dish overflowing with seafood was the same price as a small sea bass. We enjoyed the food, but 3.5 hours for a dinner was ridiculous. There are plenty of other places to get good Italian in the city. We will go elsewhere next time. "

The veal Parmesan was heavenly. A huge portion with a side of pasta marinara was delicioso! I can't remember having a better Italian meal. We were able to walk the three or so blocks to our hotel at the Marriott Medical District (the hotel shuttled us to the restaurant for free). Awesome waiter and a great meal. "
The Rosebud,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g35805-d428856-Reviews-The_Rosebud-Chicago_Illinois.html,17-Dec-16,5,This is where it all began,"My wife and I have heard many wonderful things about The Rosebud restaurant at 1500 West Taylor Street in Ukrainian Village over the years. Time and time again we promised to include it on our to-do list but we never got around to making a reservation. Until recently. Now we know what we were missing. Rosebud, the original Rosebud, the one that launched a thousand bruschettas and chicken Vesuvios and BBQ ribs, has been one of Chicago's finest Italian restaurants for more than 40 years. Alex Dana started it all at the original Rosebud on Taylor Street. Now Dana's Rosebud Restaurant Group features eight locations in the Chicago area, including Rosebud on Rush and Carmine's. Rosebud is expensive, loud and crowded, what you would expect of an Italian eatery that offers huge portions of traditional Italian fare of consistently good quality. It is famous for its Chicken Vesuvio and Square Noodles and Baked Clams and Tiramisu. But the menu includes so many delicious options, from the bread basket to dessert, that diners are guaranteed not to go home hungry. My wife is half-Italian so she was in heaven. We tried to sample as much as we could and then observed how adjacent customers were enjoying their meals. We started with minestrone and Caesar salad and shared a plate of bruschetta. My wife loves meat ravioli, an item that isn't included on many menus (only cheese). I can't resist a big plate of spaghetti and meatballs. But others in the room were very satisfied with baked lasagna, Saltimbocca (another of my wife's favorites), chicken Vesuvio, Lake whitefish, Norwegian salmon, jumbo shrimp, BBQ ribs and roasted potato wedges. We vowed to return soon, crowd or no crowd."
The Rosebud,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g35805-d428856-Reviews-The_Rosebud-Chicago_Illinois.html,12-Dec-16,5,Visited restaurant for after graduation meal and birthday celebrations,"Very friendly staff from entering the restaurant to exit.Chef was willing to customize dishes and the food was great. Food is reasonably priced and portions are large. I will be returning to try other dishes...we had the fettuccine alfredo with shrimp, fried calamari, stuffed mushrooms, and chicken calabrese.... each was very scrumptious."
The Rosebud,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g35805-d428856-Reviews-The_Rosebud-Chicago_Illinois.html,8-Dec-16,4,Almost a perfect night.,"Incredible food. Lobster ravioli, linguine with clams, jumbo shrimp milanes. Traditional, almost mafia-like atmosphere. One small problem, our waiter was a little pushy at times. I think he came to our table three times before we were ready to order. It seemed as if he wanted to turn the table as quickly as possible, too. Outside of that, it was a great night.For travelers, The Rosebud at Taylor St. offers complimentary shuttle service to the United Center. We didn't use it because it leaves only a half hour before game time, but we thought about it. It's a nice perk."
The Rosebud,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g35805-d428856-Reviews-The_Rosebud-Chicago_Illinois.html,29-Nov-16,5,Fantastic.,Rosebud was fantastic. I have been wanting to come here for over 25 years. I've been to Chicago many times but unable to come to Rosebud. The food was everything I expected. My rigatoni ala vodka was made with real cream. My son's fettucine Alfredo was bowl licking good. The bread basket delivered when we first sat down. It was hot and delicious. The calzone for dessert was wonderful. We will be back in less than 30 years the next time. The service was sensational.
The Rosebud,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g35805-d428856-Reviews-The_Rosebud-Chicago_Illinois.html,4-Nov-16,5,Perfect for both - a quick meal or a mini celebration ,The Rosebud on Taylor Street is definitely one of the nicer places in Little Italy to break bread with friends and family. The ambience is in keeping with the fine dining Italian place that this chain of restaurants is known for. The food is never a disappointment. They have valet parking too which makes it so much easier considering the police are always on the watch for cars that have been parked without the street permit. My number one recommendation for the best spot to eat at in Little Italy.

The Rosebud,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g35805-d428856-Reviews-The_Rosebud-Chicago_Illinois.html,25-Sep-16,3,Menu prices higher than on website,"Our meal here did not meet our expectations for a high-quality meal with great service. We asked the waiter if the dishes were family-style, and he said it could be anything (so we thought he meant individual dishes). As it turns out, the plates are definitely family-style, and do not come with any vegetables or sides, so it's better to order entrees and sides for your table to share. The entree plates are way too large for one person.Food is good, but does not meet the bar for the price. We were also surprised to see the prices for dinner at the restaurant were significantly higher than the menu shown on the website (which may be for lunch only). We spent much more for dinner than expected.Service was fair. It took a while to get the check and water service, and the waiter could not recommend a wine to go with the dinner. The restaurant is quiet and a bit crowded and dark, but nice."

He had the Veal Marsala and I had the Veal Piccata. Both dishes came with 3 thin slices of fork tender veal. No need for the very sharp knives they brought out for us. My veal piccata was topped with fresh stemmed capers. The house salad was very fresh and large enough for both of us to share (which we did). The authentic hard crust tender Italian bread was served warm with olive oil already at table.

The menu offerings for the evening were much more limited than what is shown on the internet, and some of the items we would have considered were not available. My wife ordered the Chilean sea bass special, which was tasty but nothing special, and I tried rigatoni with meatballs, which was okay but again nothing special. We also thought the bread was absolutely awful. Service was good and pleasant, but considering the fact that the prices were high and the food unimpressive, I would recommend trying a different restaurant."

Just a quick walk from the hospital, no reservations required. Loved the atmosphere, old italian. Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra playing in the background.I ordered the Chicken Piccata and my husband had the Chicken Fettucini Alfredo. The food was delicious, fresh bread with olive oil to accompany. And the service was warm and friendly. Would definitly visit again."
The Rosebud,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g35805-d428856-Reviews-The_Rosebud-Chicago_Illinois.html,15-Aug-16,4,Excellent Food,"From what I understand this restaurant is an institution & we loved it. But there is one thing that could make a diner's experience here a little better. Please add descriptions on your menu!!! I felt like an idiot asking our waiter what almost every chicken dish was. The obvious ones I knew-but some of the names needed a description-like brick chicken. The servings are large and that was a plus for our hungry crowd. We would dine here again. We wanted to go to the original location but it was a hike to get here from our hotel in the city. Had I known more about Chicago, I would have chosen a location closer to our hotel. I also assumed, incorrectly, that Little Italy would be a more festive location where we could walk around after dinner. It was very quiet with little else going on. That's no reflection on this restaurant, I just thought it was worth mentioning to other tourists who may be ignorant about these things too!"
The Rosebud,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g35805-d428856-Reviews-The_Rosebud-Chicago_Illinois.html,10-Aug-16,5,Best pasta ever!,"During a visit to our son's in Chicago, we did get to Rosebud.

The Rosebud,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g35805-d428856-Reviews-The_Rosebud-Chicago_Illinois.html,4-Aug-16,3,Dinner with out-of-town friends,"I found that the vegetables were cooked very well and not over done; spinach was excellent, asparagus what very good also. Friends like the wine but I did not partake. Salmon was okay but have had better. Cheese ravioli was good. Mostacholi was okay but not exceptional. Chicken was good. Bread was standard French bread, which I do not care for but it was hot/warm. I prefer whole grain breads. The cheesecake dessert was whipped too much, and not solid enough. I love cheesecake and this did not do it for me even with the fruit on the side and whipped cream on the top which did not have to be there if it was exceptionally good cheesecake. Service was good except one order of veggies was wrong and another order was missing the veggies. Plus it was too dark in the restaurant and could not take long distance photos of the place."

The restaurant was very close to our hotel off mag mile.The cut of the steak was very good and we both ordered it med well. There was some parts of the outside that were charred which was a little disappointing.You could pick if you wanted your steak with herb butter etc.The baked potato was big enough to be shared by 2 of us. Everything is served a la carte. I thought the prices were good for the food we ordered.The staff was very attentive and gracious.There was some cinnamon raisin flat breads that were delicious.If the steak wasn't charred on the outside, I would have given it a 4!"

I had dinner there 15 years ago and remembered it was amazing so I wanted to take her there for her birthday. It lived up to and exceeded my memories of that past dinner. The host, even though we were two hours early, had no problem seating us at a very nice table. From beginning to end Marvin was wonderful! He described the specials exquisitely. And we heeded every bit of his advice! And we were glad for it. There is so much to choose from! The lobster crab oyster appetizer was mouthwatering. Crab that just melted in your mouth. Wonderful lobster! Oysters were perfect. My mom had the veal Milanese. Wonderful. I had the filet that I had when I was there before. A perfect cut of meat. The wine list was great. I picked a nice Barolo. After the meal we had coconut cake but were surprised when they brought out a lovely cannoli with fresh pistachio. A perfect end to a perfect meal. Everyone was lovely, food was worth driving 13 hours for!!! Thank you very much for helping me surprise my mom and give her a great road trip to your lovely city. You could've let an old lady's Phillies win but we understand. You are great ambassadors for your city thank you!"

We were four couples looking forward to an evening of good food, good wine, and good company and Rosebud didn't disappoint. From the mountainous and delicious mixed seafood appetizer and mixed green salad, we should have realized that we could order one main dish for every two people (or more), but we didn't. The Chicken Vesuvio, while not the best rendition in my experience was quite fine and the lasagna and seafood linguini were even better. But it was just too much food and, quite frankly, the waiter should have let us know. We were in a hotel and two of the couples were heading out of town next day, so doggie bags, which otherwise would have been welcome, didn't work. Fine bread with olive oil and very good Italian wine rounded out our dinner. We didn't have room for dessert, so I can't comment. Other than not warning us about the volume of food, the waiter was personable and excellent."

Best eggplant parmesan in Chicago! Plus spaghetti and meatballs to die for. This is the original Rosebud on Taylor Street (little Italy). Valet parking made getting there easy. Atmosphere is bustling, with small tables, and rather noisy but this is not a detriment as far as we were concerned."

It hasn't changed a bit - and I mean that in a good way. We sat at my favourite table, in the main area, under the large portrait of Frank Sinatra. We had told the kids about this place so many times and now they were able to experience it for themselves. They loved it too!True to the Rosebud group, the portions are huge and very well priced. The service is impeccable and so attentive. I am always thrilled by the service at Rosebud - it is top notch service and it is rarely found at this price point anymore. We wanted to branch out, but my daughter and I ended up sharing the eggplant Parmesan. It did not disappoint. I really don't think there is anywhere that does eggplant Parmesan better than the Rosebud restaurants. It is so thin and perfectly crusted before being layered and sauced. There really is nothing better in my opinion. We also shared a salad, which was also great. My son had the chicken Parmesan and my husband had one of the specials. Neither of them came close to finishing their selections and were smiling as they got their remaining portions to go. No room for dessert this time, but we left happy anyway. I love the details here. I love that there is a coat check and that you are greeted so kindly. I love that the place is always full, and yet well staffed so there isn't too long a wait for anything. I also love that you are not rushed out the door so they can turn the table and seat other group. They have mastered the pacing of the meal. Wouldn't change a thing, and glad they didn't!"

We decided to do a delivery through GrubHub. We ordered chicken Vesuvio and spaghetti with meatballs, along with spaghetti with sauce. The food was good and it was delivered hot and on time. The one thing that we found ordering through GrubHub is that you don't get the same choice of sides as if you ordered directly in the restaurant. Maybe we just haven't quite figured out GrubHub yet."

If you get a chance, make this a destination.THE PLACE - located on Taylor St strip in Little Italy. Little Italy looks like it's mostly university dorms now, but this was a true find. Street parking available early evening, and there's $10 valet when the street gets jumping later evenings. The decor is old school in a good way, and they play old Frank Sinatra. They even have a painting over Frank's venerated favorite table. The lighting is dim and adds to the romance. Walls are dark wood with wood columns and dark tin ceiling. The tables and settings are classic and feel like quality.THE FOOD - Amazing flavors and huge portions! Nana's Gravy dinner was the best Italian dish we have ever ordered...anywhere. I was skeptical of the wagon wheel pasta, but it complimented the pot roast meat and rich, red sauce perfectly. It was topped with ricotta cheese and fresh parsley. The bread basket had Italian and a flat bread with caramelized onions. Wedding soup was very good. The special was a cheese lasagna with shrimp, and it was delicious. The cannoli cake was enormous with perfect flavors. The cake itself wasn't overly sweet, but the strawberry sauce and hand-whipped cream was perfect with slivered almonds and icing.THE SERVICE - We were greeted immediately by a professional host. He also bid us farewell on our way out the door. We didn't have reservations, but they found us a nice, intimate table before the place got busy. The manager came by toward the end of our meal He remembered that we came in early and asked if our table was suitable. He seemed very interested in our happiness with his place. He advised that most of the wait staff has been there 8 years. One person has been there 40 years! The wait staff all had white shirts, black vests and red bow ties. All were professional, made great menu recommendations, not overly chatty, efficient and made sure we had everything we needed.THE PRICE - $93 plus tax and tip. Parking was $6. We ordered 2 glasses of wine, iced tea, a large bowl of soup, 2 entrees and dessert. We had lunch and dinner the next day from left-overs. The value was very good.Highly recommended. We can't wit to come back and try other menu items like the Penne Bolognese and re-order Nana's Gravy."

Two days earlier, we had eaten at Carmine's (same company) and had a pleasant experience, so we thought we'd try the Rosebud on Taylor. A big fan of Frank Sinatra...I was lured there with a promise to see ""his"" table. The service was excellent as was the food. My daughter had the lasagne, I had the veal parm. and my husband had the spaghetti & meatballs. All meals were of a large serving size and could be shared by two. When my husbands spaghetti & meatballs arrived, we almost passed out as the there were 2 meatballs that had to be at least 8 ounces in size each! Needless to say we left with a ""doggy"" bag and enjoyed the food the next night at our hotel. The atmosphere at this place is relaxed and comfortable. It was filled with families of all sizes and it was clear that this was a popular local neighbourhood restaurant (just the kind we love). I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone that wants to venture out of the downtown Chicago core to try local Italian fare. Well done...and we will return. Oh yes, I didn't get to eat at ""Frank's"" table, the management told me to take as many pictures as I wanted, so I sat in Frank's chair, at Frank's table under the portrait of Sinatra and raised my glass of wine to a truly great talent, after a fab meal."

Our server, Martin did an outstanding job. He was polite, caring. professional , knowledgeable about the menu and the evening menu specials AND knew the ingredients. Three cheers to him and the hostess staff. Then the wheels fell off.1/2 of our party was served the entrees, 5 minutes passed, 10 minutes passed 15 minutes passed. Where are the other entrees????!!!! Our server advised a kitchen issue was the issue. Moments later the dinners came flying out. Sadly, the first group was advised to eat so their meals would not be cold. The staff did send over a table dessert to make amends ( very good chocolate mouse/truffle cakes) but the dinner was lost due to this crucial kitchen mistake. A another review also mentioned inconsistency in two visits at this location. I must wonder if there was a change in Management/ownership, Chef, or front of the manager. Only time will tell. With loads of competition on Taylor street, I can only hope this is not the beginning of the end for this historic restaurant."

Food was ok, though service was pretty slow. Came back with another couple the following Wednesday because they love the place. We had Patrick as our server, it was like being in a totally different restaurant. Lots of personal attention, service was outstanding. One person asked for a slightly different preparation on one of the specials, Patrick suggested other changes that made it spectacular. Food was awesome. Whole experience was so much fun.

Our server (I'm sorry, I forgot her name) was friendly, helpful and accommodating. I had a glass of the Masciarelli Montepulciano and loved every drop of it; my friends resisted and each had a soda. For an appetizer, we shared the Caprese Salad; our mains were the Napoleon Eggplant Salad (which I LOVED), the Bolognese w/Pappardelle (thank you for allowing a pasta substitution) and the cheese ravioli.. all portions were large and way more then we could eat. It was sad that we didn't take our leftovers home with us but as we were flying home the next day it just wouldn't make sense.

Everyone had something different for the main course but I do believe the bone in rib-eye was the largest plate of food I had seen in awhile. I myself went with a ""vat"" full of seafood over linguine which for the first time i could not finish. Everything was tasty, fresh and more than enough.

The Rosebud,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g35805-d428856-Reviews-The_Rosebud-Chicago_Illinois.html,3-Mar-15,5,"Traditional Chicago, Delicious Italian","The Rosebud is one of those traditional Chicago style restaurants in Little Italy that serves delicious Italian food. Nothing trendy or nouvelle, but all prepared well, served by knowledgeable wait staff. We started with a caesar salad served family style, and we had the lobster ravioli - rich and filling, with a cream sauce and shrimp, as well as a pasta with a variety of seafood - mussels, clams, shrimp, fish. The sea bass was also very good. We finished with canoli, chocolate cake (a slice is can feed 4) and coffee. Portions are large and you will have a doggy bag. Prices are what you would expect from an upscale restaurant. Rosebud has several locations, but Taylor street is the original, and Little Italy is a nice scenic street.The restaurant offers valet parking for $10.00, and a cab can sometimes be difficult to find."
The Rosebud,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g35805-d428856-Reviews-The_Rosebud-Chicago_Illinois.html,1-Feb-15,5,Great Italian Food,Made reservations on line so we walked in and got our table right away even though it was a Friday night. Had a nice cozy and private table. Food selection was very large. Our food arrived quickly and was delicious. The wait staff were very friendly and made sure all our needs were met. I highly recommend this place. 
The Rosebud,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g35805-d428856-Reviews-The_Rosebud-Chicago_Illinois.html,14-Jan-15,5,Huge Portions,"This restaurant does it right. Excellent attentive wait staff. Great menu and portion sizes can actually feed two people. I love the Frank Sinatra dish. It is so good with chicken and sausage and roasted peppers. It is so large, but amazing."
The Rosebud,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g35805-d428856-Reviews-The_Rosebud-Chicago_Illinois.html,9-Jan-15,5,Magificent Italian,"Awesome Italian food. Like a lot of good Italian restaurants, not to flashy from the outside but once you step inside you know you are in for an authentic Italian meal. A very warm, historic, and friendly atmosphere. The entire staff is very professional. Our waiter, Patrick, made us feel like we had eaten their many times even though this was our first visit. The portions are very large but they are so good it is hard to stop eating when you reach that full stage:) We had the spaghetti and meatballs and the lasagne. Both were best of each. If you are looking for a wonderful Italian meal, look no further than The Rosebud in Little Italy. You will not be sorry, but go hungry."
The Rosebud,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g35805-d428856-Reviews-The_Rosebud-Chicago_Illinois.html,1-Jan-15,5,Great place!,I've been here a few times since it is very close to my workplace and it's always great. Everything is delicious and their staff is always friendly. What I love about it most is that it doesn't have that pompous vibe that other classier restaurants tend to have.
The Rosebud,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g35805-d428856-Reviews-The_Rosebud-Chicago_Illinois.html,31-Dec-14,5,Just about our favorite restaurant in Chicago,"We have eaten at every steak and chop house in the city, almost. We love coming to the Rosebud on Taylor. Let me qualify that, we love coming there if we are seated in the main dining room. It is a classic Italian eatery with white table cloths, busy waiters, and a usually packed room. Yes, you need reservations. This is a favorite of many locals. Lots of family get togethers, parties, etc. We ate here on Valentine's Day one year with reservations and got stuck upstairs at a tiny table in the overflow area. No atmosphere, but the food was still good.The best meal we ever had here involved Osso Bucco, need I say more. This Sunday night we had a special of crab stuffed ravioli with a red pepper sauce. Very nice. Fried calamari to start and an order of meat balls to take home. The meat balls make it the 200 mile drive like champs and go right in the freezer. Yum."
The Rosebud,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g35805-d428856-Reviews-The_Rosebud-Chicago_Illinois.html,18-Dec-14,5,birthday dinner,"Wonderful Italian food and old-town atmosphere. Plan on spending at least 2 hours for dinner. multiple courses, fantastic service, perfectly timed sequence. The Italian food is the best I've ever had. It's not cheap but you get what you pay for. You don't have to dress up to dine but if you want to dress formal, that will work, too. Kid friendly but plan on having something to keep them entertained. Definitely going back!"

The atmosphere is very comfortable and there is a definite charm to this place. The servers are extreemly accommodating in every possible way. Some may claim this to be a rather expensive restaurant but in my opinion the portions, presentation and quality of the food served more than justifies the prices. The Rosebud continues to be a favorite of mine when visiting this area of Chicago."

It is NOTHING like Little Italy in NYC or Boston. It is one or two blocks with a few restaurants & bars. Not all of them are Italian, by the way.We were there on a Sat. night and it was quite busy, though we were seated pretty quickly. It's not what I would call an ""authentic"" Italian restaurant; it's more of a chain restaurant. That said, the service was good; the Sangria was very good; the pasta was good; nothing was exceptional. Would I go again? Probably not, only because Chicago has such a wide variety of dining choices."

I'd recommend making reservations about an hour ahead of time. We were seated quickly once we arrived 5 minutes before our reserved time. The servers are all polite and helpful. The manager walks around and checks on guests. The only thing I'd recommend is larger font on the menus, especially with dim lighting. My parents couldn't see the drink list so they ultimately took out the light on their phone. (Yes, slightly embarassing but funny) we were kinda in a rush so we didn't get to sit and enjoy everything entirely, but everyone agreed it was great. I ordered chicken parmesan. The best! My sister ordered rigatoni a la vodka. My mom had a pork chop dish. My dad ordered a broccoli and shrimp pasta dish. I'd definitely say split the dishes if you aren't interested in taking home leftovers. They are large servings, so you do get what you pay for. So going to come back! "

Lots...of traditional Italian dishes and they specialize lemon chicken and eggplant parm.  Sone good quirky is the menu is shown on a chalkboard.  Bad quirky is they don’t have any beers on tap (bottles only), even though they have a full bar and it is cash only.  Just kind of a pain to make sure you have enough cash to pay for everything.  However, there is an ATM on site.  Dishes are reasonably priced.  Most cost between $10-20.  No sides come with the entrees but you did get a large basket of bread to start off the meal.  No reservations are accepted but the restaurant wasn’t too crowded the Friday night we went.  May be most crowded when there is a Blackhawks game going on that night as the bar area is littered with Blackhawk paraphernalia.  Kid friendly restaurant.More"

There's an ATM in the bar area for anyone who forgot to bring cash with them. Prices are low (for Chicago) and the food is high-quality! Enjoy!

It's an old fashioned restaurant where many of the patrons seemed to know each other. After having a drink at the bar, the four of us were seated at a nice table in a sun room type area. There are no paper menus. All the food items are written on big chalk boards which I found a bit hard to read.  I ordered the chicken Parmesan, again on recommendation. I thought it was odd that the chicken was shaped in two perfect rectangles, but it was tender and juicy. There was enough sauce and cheese to cover the side of pasta that came along with the meal. My husband's meal was the real winner. He ordered stuffed shells that were overflowing with a well seasoned ricotta. They were delicious.If you are looking for a casual home style Italian restaurant, this is the place to go. The atmosphere was homey, and servers were friendly and helpful."

From the cavatelli to the stuffed shells, from the marinara sauce to the vodka sauce, you cannot go wrong with any of their pasta dishes. Certain unique touches, such as no menus, only strategically-place chalkboards and a strict cash-only policy adds to the charm of this spot."

Nothing too fancy other than the great value of the food you get here. Traditional recipes with some adaptation/americanization, but otherwise true to their form. The place is more like a meat market or deli, but depending on what you get, you are looking at a meal that will be cooked to order, with great passion and excellent ingredients. There are tables inside and outside, but the place is small and fills up quickly during lunch hour. It has been featured in the DDD tv show and that should give you an idea of the type of joint this one is. Run by the owners and attended with a smile, you're in for a great experience as long as you don't expect a black tablecloth experience. "

We were hosted by the folks at Tufano's with nothing but great food, drink and friendly service. The italian dressing was home made and yummy, the pasta dishes were so good and the tiramisu... WoW!!! Yum-O! The location is original and feels comfortable. The staff is ready to serve and well versed on their menu. It's a great family restaurant or a great date night location.

The menu offered an interesting selection, and my food (served too quickly causing me to feel a bit rushed) was very, very good, but not exceptional. Basically, standard Italian fare. In addition, the decor is unremarkable at best, and although I know it's been in the same family for 75 years, the interior doesn't reflect and special patina or period influence as much as it's just ""plain Jane"". The bread was nothing special and they were certainly stingy with the butter. I knew I wasn't getting attention from the waitress when, by the time she was available to ask for more butter, I'd just about finished my dinner. I had to ask someone else to get me a glass of wine, and when it was time for desert, my original waitress made no effort to explain what was offered with any enthusiasm. Maybe she was having an off day, but for a restaurant with so many excellent ratings, I'd like to assume my experience was an anomaly. Finally, the valet parking, while reasonably priced, was awkward and a bit slow. Worth visiting, and I try again next time I'm in town, but it will be for convenience and just for a good, not great meal."

The owner, Joey, is a great guy and has carried on the tradition started by his family. The food is genuine Italian (and it's called gravy not sauce!). Dishes are simple but excellent, very reasonably priced, with good service. The vesuvio chikcen and potatoes are the best I've ever had. No frills, just a great place to meet with friends and family. Try the house chianti, it's unique and really compliments the food. Very busy on nights when the Blackhawks or Bulls have a home game."

I have never had a bad meal there. The atmosphere is like eating in your Aunt Rosie's basement - simple, loud, and extremely welcoming. The house and antipasta salads are very vinegary, but so wasAunt Rosie's and I learned to love that. The menu in general is large. Lots of meat and chicken choices and many, many pasta dishes. All are excellent. Nothing is ever too salty (a sure sign of bottled something or other) or over seasoned. Their gravy (read red/spaghetti sauce for non-Italian folks) is delicious and truly like Mama made it. Now here is the kicker, I kid you not, theymake the best fried calamari anywhere, anytime; and I have tried a lot of calamari in my day. Crisp breading and really tasty with the calamari itself moist and tender - absolutely no tough,chewy pieces ever. Wines by the glass are decent choices and Kim Crawford Sauvignon Blanc at $7.50 a glass is kind of unbelievable. They only take cash, but who cares the whole damn menu is a deal. Valet parking is free, just a tip. You won't find a better bargain or better straight forward good eating anywhere else. I recommend it highly. To top it off they are really nice people. The family is always there to meet you and greet you. I live about 8 miles away but we know folks who come from Crystal Lake quite regularly, that's how good it is. Go, eat, have a good time - ""mangiare bene""!"

It's a family restaurant that was closing the next day for a relative's funeral.Here we were treated like friends the staff wanted to have return. We had the merlot which was smooth and so good we indulged in an second glass. The calamari was served piping hot and awakened my memory of eating fried clams a beach shack on the South Shore in Boston. The Tufano salad is big enough for two to share and included artichoke hearts (my favorite), two kinds of cheese, Italian salami and black olives. We split an order of lemoni veal, with a subtle sauce and served on a bed of wonderful angel hair pasta. The spumoni was very rich and flavorful. The restaurant is in a residential neighborhood so it has no sign and you should use the valet parking for convenience and to avoid a parking ticket. This is not elegant dining, but you will feel relaxed and at home here. I have already suggested it to friends."

But if you are in the neighborhood which contains many other Italian restaurants, Tufano's is a place to stop. If you're coming on a night of a concert or something going on at the UIC Pavilion or the United Center, be sure to come early, or about the start time of the event, as it can be quite busy. But the food is definitely worth the trip. There is no menu, as everything is written on large chalkboards. We had the special salad appetizer and bruschetta and there was more than enough for four of us. Each had a different entree and no one was disappointed From the veal parmigiana to the shells with ricotta cheese, everything was delicious. Top it off with a cannoli and you will have a great meal. The only drawback is that Tufano's is a cash only restaurant, but there is an ATM on the premises. Worth a trip for an authentic Italian meal!"

The calamari here is seasoned PERFECTLY, crisp on the outside, and tender inside (so many other places make it waaaay too chewy, not here!). I've made a special trip to the restaurant to get a big tub of this-and nothing else- for takeout. So worth the trip.

We were there for our first time this Saturday night, and the place was packed, but we didn't feel rushed at all. Our waitress, Emily, was one of the most amazing servers we have had at any restaurant. She is a credit to Tufanos and one of the many reasons we would go back. She was honest, had great recommendations, and was a doll to boot! The fettucine alfredo was yummy but could have been a bit more salty. The salad was fresh-tasting, and all of our pasta dishes were yummy and big enough for leftovers.If it is nice out, sit in the outdoor seating area which looks over a large fountain. We were there at night, and it had such a fun ""Chicago summer night"" feel. Eating inside with a group of five or more is great as well due to the round tables. So nice to be able to see and hear everyone.Prices are wonderful! For five full entrees, one soda, three desserts, and one salad, our total bill was $70."

Instead of potatoes, she substituted broccoli and it was really delicious. We also ordered the half order of calamari and I believe we would have been fine without it. The workers were very attentive. Wasn't sure how to pay at first. Left the bill there with my card but it wasn't until I got up to ask where to pay, when I was then told they do not take card.

We were seated promptly at a table close to the entrance/door, against a wall, and jammed close to everyone else.  The way the four-person...was situated on an angle yet against the wall meant that we were constantly getting bumped into (in fact, at one point a water bumped into my husband's arm so hard he spilled his food a bit as he was eating) because the staff used a very tiny area in between our table and another to get by.  We commented to each other that simply having a two-person table could've solved this problem.  Indeed, it was so crowded in there and we noticed it seemed that all couples were seated at four-person tables as there didn't seem to be any two-person tables to alleviate the cramped space.  We kept moving our table as close to the wall as possible until finally we asked the host before seating the next party behind us if she could move that table behind us back farther so we could move our farther from the man-made aisle.  It was also very frigid in there.  I had to wear my coat during most of the meal and I commented that I wished I had brought my fingertip-less gloves to wear while I ate.  And I wasn't the only one as I witnessed two others (men) complain to an employee about how cold they were.  We ordered calamari and caprese salad for appetizers, both of which were good, but we've had much better at other restaurants recently.  I ordered clam chowder soup and cesar salad as my main dish.  My husband ordered spaghettini di mar for his main dish.  Both were tasty.  Our server was really great at coming by to ask us if we wanted refills on our drinks and how the food was.More"

Stax Cafe is open for breakfast and lunch, but the concept is the best classic American breakfast that you can find with fresh and locally-sourced ingredients. They do have a couple of different things on the menu. We tried the chocolate French toast topped with cherry compote. We also had the chocolate chip peanut butter pancakes with bananas. The food was delicious and the service was very good. Our server was personable and efficient. Two excellent breakfast-lunch restaurants within a half block - only in the middle of Little Italy."
Stax Cafe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g35805-d3802776-Reviews-Stax_Cafe-Chicago_Illinois.html,20-Apr-17,5,A reminder that breakfast is the most important meal of the day,"If case you've forgotten in an era of fast-food restaurants, pizza parlors and hot dog stands, breakfast is the most important meal of the day. That means eggs and bacon, not Italian beef. Stax Cafe at 1401 West Taylor Street, between Racine and Ashland, offers a daily reminder that breakfast not only is healthy but it isn't boring. The 85-seat eatery puts a modern spin on a classic diner atmosphere by offering breakfast classics all day with fresh juices, smoothies and a small lunch menu. The menu features pancakes, crepes, eggs, omelettes, French toast, waffles, soups, salads and sandwiches. But there is a difference between a pancake and a Stax pancake or a crepe and a Stax crepe. See for yourself. How about a stack of oatmeal pancakes loaded with fresh blueberries and topped with Greek yogurt, blueberry compote, granola and drizzled with honey? Or an oatmeal waffle with apples, cinnamon and granola? Or a mixed berry crepe soaked with raspberry coulis and topped with whipped cream? Or a banana macadamia nut crepe with chocolate caramel and gelato? That's my wife's favorite. Me? I can't resist the Classic Benedict, with Black Forest ham, poached eggs and hollandaise sauce, and the Brisket Benedict, pulled braised beef brisket sauteed with celery, carrots and onions loaded on top of an English muffin with poached eggs and hollandaise sauce. That's not breakfast, it's a special event. Eggs never tasted so good."

Overall I enjoyed this quaint little cafe but as always there is always room for any establishment to improve! I ordered the green chili chilaquiles and they were a 4 out of 5..don't get me wrong I'm always up for green chili but this dish went a little overboard with a chili that was just okay,not so amazing that the dish needed to be drowned in it. My boyfriend on the other hand got the starving student with the mini waffles and when I say I usually hate waffles I mean it but I would eat stax waffles everyday for breakfast if I could and the bacon didn't look like the usual cheap thin bacon you have come to expect when dining out but rather thick cut maple bacon. The waitress was okay could have had a little more personality. One thing that bothered me major was,from where I sat I was able to see the coffee bar and yet I had no idea what was offered because there was no menu or so I thought, it was thrown on the table we discovered after ordering. Overall the space is small but offers a welcoming feeling and the food is pretty good and not overly priced which is always nice!"

Wait was only 25 minutes at 10:30. Benedicts, pancakes, lemon waffles, sausage, bacon (crispy just like I requested), strawberry orange juice and intelligensia coffee were quite good. Interesting specials but we tend to stick to our old standbys. Service was efficient, quick, pleasant and not at all pushy despite the waiting customers. Never felt rushed. We've been here several times and it's always great. Seating is a bit cramped, but the noise level was not a problem. Easy on street parking and an easy ride not far off the Eisenhower expressway. Will go again and again. Try it."

The food was above average and better than you would get at your run of the mill chain type places, but other than the freshly juiced grapefruit juice (which was amazing!) everything else was just average or slightly above average. The prices were in line with everything else in Chicago which is to say horribly inflated. I got the French Toast with bananas, a side of sausage and the juice. My wife got Lemon Poppy-seed Waffles with Blueberries and coffee. I had to scrape the bananas off as they were not good bordering on bad and the sausage had zero flavor whatsoever. My wife seemed to enjoy her waffles but agrees that our entire meal was overpriced and overrated."

We went at around 7 or 8am on a Saturday and they had lots of open seating. It's not your classic cheap $4 breakfast diner, but it's fairly priced (about $10) for the amount of food you get (lots), similar to Yolk and other newer breakfast places. The main dishes were nothing special (I got a wrap and my wife got the chorizo frittata), but they have phenomenal potatoes (perfectly crispy with just the right amount of kosher salt). My mini white chocolate raspberry pancakes were delightful, as were my wife's lemon poppyseed mini waffles. They serve Intelligentsia coffee, which was delicious as well.

In one of those ""let's see what's over this way"" explorations of unfamiliar neighborhoods, we happened upon this Taylor Street hotspot.This place combines entirely satisfying meals with unexpected results of new thinking in cuisine. Imagine ricotta pancakes, for example. Actually, don't - just experience the fluffy not-too-sweet concoction that does not require syrup to be enjoyed. The Spanish Harlem omelet combined chorizo, queso fresco, roasted red peppers and was mouth watering. My choice of a side was the mini waffles - which I ordered because they were ""cute"" but ended up being sublime. Intelligensia coffee gave me some fuel for the long day of sauntering in the city. No wonder Michelin gave this University Village restaurant a recommendation.Strange coincidence? The mayor of my south suburban home town wandered in with his wife, and all of us remarked how we unexpectedly drawn to this place. We'll all be back."

The menu offers a wide assortment of food, including eggs, pancakes, waffles crepes, salads, sandwiches and wraps. On my latest visit for breakfast I had a simple dish of eggs over easy and sausage links with coffee and a side of assorted cut fruit as a substitute for the house potatoes. The eggs were properly cooked and the sausage links, which are a little plumper than usually served in this type of eatery, were flavorful. The quality of the fruit was average, but it was amply served in a bowl rather than a cup and nicely chilled. Moreover, there was no charge for the substitution. ‘Intelligentsia’ is the brand of coffee served and its pretty good. My waitress was attentive and competent. Expect to wait during peak hours, but the lines usually move at a decent pace. Some of the dishes are a bit overpriced, so be judicious in your selections."

The taste was fantastic. The sausage was smoky and the mustard and onions added the perfect complement. These were not greasy or heavy at all, more like a hot dog than the sausage sandwiches you get at the county fair. The sandwiches wall came with fries, which were very crispy and tasty. Price was very reasonable. This was the cheapest meal we had all week. Servers were also very friendly. Great place for a Chicago classic."

So which Chicago sandwich shop produces the best pork chop sandwich? What makes a great pork chop sandwich? Start with a bone-in pork chop. Dredge it lightly in flour and cook it in a healthy amount of oil until it is golden brown and crisply. Then put the tender, juicy pork chop between a steamed bun with a layer of yellow salad mustard and top it with a mountain of grilled Spanish onions and spicy hot sport peppers. One place you can find this iconic sandwich is Jim's Original Hot Dog stand. Located at 1250 South Union Street, at Rochford Street, south of Roosevelt Road, next to the Dan Ryan Expressway, in the University Village and Little Italy neighborhoods, it is an old school hot dog stand that started in 1939 and is open 24 hours a day. Jim's is more widely known for its all-beef hot dog and the first Maxwell Street Polish sausage sandwich, which it introduced in 1943. But old-timers insist that the oldest continuously operating hot dog stand to have once done business on Maxwell Street that Jim's bone-in pork chop sandwich is every bit as good if not better. In fact, the bone-in pork chop sandwich also was invented at Jim's, also in 1943. Other competitors for ""best pork chop sandwich"" include Maxwell Street Depot in Bridgeport and Original Maxwell Street in West Garfield Park."

Jim's Original Hot Dog has been selling hot dogs since 1943. They actually began on Maxwell Street, but when Maxwell Street was re-done, Jim's Original Hot Dog moved over to the 1250 S. Union location. I remember eating here while attending the Chicago police academy when it was located here. Now, all that remains of that time is the street named for the former superintendent. But, I digress. This time, we decided to do a taste test and pick up one Polish sausage sandwich from Jim's Original Hot Dog and one Polish sausage sandwich from Express Grill. We decided to each eat one half and then switch. So, we found that the Polish sausage was very similar tasting and probably is from the same supplier. On top of the Polish sausage sandwich were mounds of sweet colossal Spanish onions, two huge sport peppers and a bed of yellow salad mustard on the bun. We thought that the onions tasted great. The French fries at Jim's Original Hot Dog were not the crinkle-type, so they didn't seem as crisp as the French fries from Express Grill. Both sandwiches come with a small bag of French fries and both sandwiches are $5.15 each Jim's Original Hot Dog is the first of the two hot dog stands on this block of S.

Located at 1250 South Union Avenue, at the southwest corner of Union and James Rochford Street, it started at Maxwell and Halsted but moved to its current location in the wake of the University of Illinois-Chicago's expansion. Jim's claim to fame is the original Maxwell Street Polish Sausage sandwich, which it created in 1943. It features Polish sausage on a hot bun with a layer of yellow salad mustard topped with a mountain of Sweet Colossal Spanish onions and spicy hot sport peppers. With a free order of fries. Honestly, I've never warmed to Polish sausage or brats. But I truly enjoy Jim's cheeseburger with grilled ground beef on a hot bun with yellow mustard, onions, peppers and a slice of American cheese and Jim's filet of fish sandwich with tender whitefish on a hot bun with tartar sauce and onions. My wife prefers the chicken breast sandwich. Imagine, a hot dog stand that isn't noted for its hot dogs. Perhaps that's because Jim's version is a 100 percent beef hot dog with yellow mustard, onions and peppers, not the more celebrated Chicago-style model. Jim's pork chops sandwich also is very popular. Jim's has been in business for 80 years. So he must be doing something right."

The food isn't ""better"" than anywhere else in my opinion, but there's a lot of kitsch appeal because it's a walk-up window and it's got the history and everything so it psychologically feels cooler than an average greasy spoon. That being said, you should certainly come here as a tourist or a hot dog stand enthusiast or because you saw it on a food show somewhere.

Jim's is the first hot dog stand that you come to when you are driving southbound on Union Ave. I must admit that I think that people park rather sloppily on the street and for that one reason, I would consider the second hot dog stand. But since the food is pretty comparable we ordered a Polish sandwich and a single cheeseburger - both with everything. Now, each sandwich comes with French fries, so though we wanted a single order of cheese fries, we ended up with four orders of French fries with a cup of cheese. Oh, well, the food was exactly what we were looking for. The prices are reasonable and they do accept credit cards."

Enjoyed both along with half a meatball sandwich on this visit.

Order at the register, they bring you your food, pretty quick. If you’re ordering gluten-free it’ll be 20 minutes, so we called ahead for that. Just a few blocks from Mario’s Italian ice.More"

Parking was easy.  There was no line.  We chose the BBQ beef pizza which comes with not enough BBQ sauce.  We also got a piece of the turkey and...dressing strudel.

Pompei,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g35805-d428857-Reviews-Pompei-Chicago_Illinois.html,5-Jan-20,5,A Davino family tradition since 1909,"With all of the new restaurants popping up from one side of Chicago to the other, even 79-year-old retirees sometimes forget about the traditional supper clubs and old-time restaurants that set a standard for the newcomers to follow. Like Pompei, a Davino family tradition since...1909. Located at 1531 West Taylor Street in Chicago's historic Little Italy neighborhood, east of Ashland, in the midst of the far-flung University of Illinois-Chicago campus, it is a casual, family-owned restaurant serving cafeteria-style Italian food and desserts. Dine in, drive up, carryout or delivery, it is the home of the Pizza Strudel and the square Napolitano style pizza. In recent months, my wife and I have taken pains to visit some of the old-time treasures of Chicago dining, restaurants and pubs with histories that date to the early 1900s. There are more of them than you might suspect. Pompei is one of them. Open at 10 a.m. daily, it reminds my half-Italian wife what good old home-cooked Italian food used to taste like, the way her Italian grandmother used to do it. We started with garlic bread, bruschetta, minestrone and Caesar salad with romaine, parmesan, garlic croutons and Caesar dressing. Naturally, we had to sample some signature Pizza Strudel, the Pompei Italiano Strudel with meatballs, green peppers, marinara sauce and cheese and the BBQ Beef Strudel with sliced beef, BBQ sauce and cheese. Like cheese strudels and unlike calzones, Pompei's pizza strudel features less crust and more fillings wrapped in pizza dough. A truly delicious concept. We also shared an order of spaghetti with Napolitano meat sauce, a combination of pork and beef simmered with tomatoes and seasonings. For dessert, we couldn't pass up sharing two of the Davino family's home-made favorites, tiramisu and bread pudding. How many restaurants can say they have been satisfying customers with home-made recipes for 111 years?More"
Pompei,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g35805-d428857-Reviews-Pompei-Chicago_Illinois.html,19-Dec-19,5,Always a good choice,"We had been in the West Loop most of the afternoon at meetings and rather than fight traffic on the expressway during a wet rush hour, we decided to go to Pompei for dinner.  They had some great specials, one of which I tried.  We...ordered two slices of the thin pizza.  I also ordered the half breaded steak sandwich and the bowl of beef vegetable soup special.  Pompei was not very busy, so it was a very nice and relaxing meal.  We topped off the meal with some gelato - two scoops of butter pecan and two scoops of pistachio.  We took home two pieces of strudel - a BBQ beef slice and a turkey & stuffing slice, as well as a piece of banana walnut cake and a piece of chocolate cake.  I must admit, that though I like Ricobene’s for their breaded stea, Pompei’s breaded steak gave it a run for the money.  I found the Pompei breaded steak to be a bit more tender.More"

My chicken parmesan arrived within 5 minutes of me ordering it and my appetiser arrived 5 minutes after that. The chicken was so old and tough, I could barely manage to cut through it with my...knife. It was clear that it had been reheated many times and put under a heating lamp. It was stale pink in colour and inedible. I was forced to tell the server and he replied saying that the chicken was deep fried and thats why it was hard. He then said he would speak to the manager and informed me they can make a new one.  The only reason I am giving this restaurant 2 stars is because the re-made chicken parmesan was actually made to order. The calamari was average. Disappointed in this restaurant, especially considering how many customers dine here. I was surprised at the quality and price for below-average food.More"

I don’t even write reviews - but this was so bad that I had to warn the general public.  I can’t believe what I just ate. For such a busy restaurant which has been open since...1909, the chicken parmigiana that I ordered was also from 1909. I felt like I was on an episode of kitchen nightmares. The chicken was dry and totally impenetrable with my knife. It was so tough and was so frozen and old. It was obviously reheated about 50 times. I have no idea why it’s so busy, because the quality was abysmal. Picture paying 30 dollars for a microwaveable TV dinner. Classless.More"

The owner/manager and sister of the owner has taken this resposibility. She is never there, and does not return calls in a timely fashion. She does not have an email on the website, so she is unavailable electronically. I tried to set this up for a week and I still don't have a response. I tried to voice my frustration to Pete one of the managers, since he said he was a family member, so he could pass on my frustration. He basically told me that since she was the owner I could/should not criticize her hours 11:00-4:30. No one would give me a time when she came in or left. But it seems to be sometime after 11:00 and sometime before 4:30. Really???? He was rude and very abrasive. Not a good way to do business. I don't think they really want my business.

The prices are somewhat high, especially if you want a soup and/or salad plus an entree, you can be looking at $15+ for a ""fast food"" meal. You place your order at the counter with a somewhat sloppily-dressed, scruffy and generally uninterested employee, pay a similar-type employee and wait at your table for your food to be delivered by, you guessed it the same type employee.It's an OK place if you are nearby and want some quick Italian food, but there are certainly better options."

The food was just average nothing to really brag over except their desserts which were out of this world. The staff was friendly and aiming to please. The restaurant is kid friendly and seems to attracted the local police and sheriff deputies and fire departments as well. There is free parking behind the restaurant at the school and indoor and outdoor seating. We had their lasagna's, spagetti and fettucini dishes and tried a variety of their home made desserts as well."

We placed our order for pickup at 8pm. We were told that it would be ready at 8:30. We got there at 8:35. They didn’t start cooking our...food until around 8:50. Finally around 9:05, our food was ready. Needless to say that after finally getting our food and getting home, which is a few minutes away, the food was cold.  I recognize and appreciate that all businesses are now dealing with staffing issues. However, we first called and was required to pay for our food during the call (I now know why). If, when calling at 8, we were told that our food would not be ready until 9:05, perhaps we would have made a different decision about where to eat. This restaurant knew that they were busy and decided that it was better for them for us to wait than be up front about the real wait time.  When I questioned the manager about why it took over an hour to make 8 tacos, he displayed a nasty attitude and complete disregard for the wasted time we spent waiting on our food.  Rather than try to explain what happened with our order, he curtly decided to either offer a refund or finish preparing our food. After already waiting an hour we decided to waste more time waiting for our food.  There are many good options on Taylor street that respect their customers and their time. We definitely won’t be back here againMore"

STAY AWAY.,"This place is a joke. My fiancee and I were planning on having our wedding reception here, being that it was to be a small wedding and planned very quickly. The chef who we dealt with was very accommodating, and we had a verbal agreement...with everything we wanted.   Before we had a chance to draft up a formal contract, we found out that the chef had quit and we were to deal with another one of the managers there. After we got worried we were going to have to rework out our deal, he told us we had nothing to worry about, the original terms would be honored, and he would get the contract together.   Literally one week before our wedding, the owner of the restaurant calls my fiancee' and would not agree to anything near what was agreed upon, wanting to charge us nearly double of what we were originally promised. He knew we were in a very difficult position and tried to take advantage of us. This is a horrible way to conduct business and no matter how much it ruined our wedding, I was not going to let this man hold us hostage. We found another restaurant literally 4 DAYS before the wedding and made the most of a bad situation.   I wish the story would end there, but unfortunately it does not. Since we put a $1000 deposit down on a credit card, we received a check from the restaurant reimbursing the money. The maid of honor, however, was not as lucky. She wrote them a check for $300 to help with the liquor cost, and we were returned the check, as the restaurant claimed they did not cash it. Only it turns out they did. When we confronted the owner about this, he claims we were given ""cash"" back and not the check. How he knew this, we have no idea... we never even met him in person. We dealt with the manager, who it turns out doesn't even work there anymore either! He refused to give her the money back and literally told us ""do what you want about it"" and hung up on us, knowing full well it is our word against his, and it would not be worth taking him to court over $300. After months of attempting to meet in person with him and not having any luck, we have given up.  This man is not worthy of owning a restaurant and I encourage others to stay away from this place. Someone of his character does not deserve your business. I am not one to write reviews, but I needed to tell my story. If for whatever reason you need to plan a party with this place, ensure you get everything in writing and sign a contract the MINUTE you have a deal to avoid their shady business practices. WE DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS RESTAURANT TO ANYONE!!!!More"

Great food, atmosphere, AND FREE PARKING!!!!  You'd pay more for parking downtown than for your ""special"".  Chances are, for a business luncheon, you'll pay more for parking downtown than the whole meal.  SUPER place.  Now that I know it's there, I will be using it.  Service could have been a little faster but we were not in a hurry.More"

The cerveza selection was exactly what we were looking for.  Servers were always attentive to make sure they arrived to take our order for the next round, refill our water, and beer, glasses.

There are a number of sandwiches that I like with sweet potato fries or a salad (that I never had) but there is a good variety. There is seating inside or out. My favorite part of coming to Hawkeye's is the owner. Jim is so personable and friendly and really makes you feel welcome and appreciates your business. He has been on site every time I have been there . He has a real passion for his business and his customers. I have even seen him bring a dog "" a drink"" on the patio. Everyone is welcome here!.

Hawkeye's Bar & Grill,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g35805-d428868-Reviews-Hawkeye_s_Bar_Grill-Chicago_Illinois.html,27-Apr-18,1,Hawkeye's has hit the skids,"My wife & I have been going here for almost three decades, and It was always a fun place that happened to have great bar food.  Today, we decided to go there for dinner because we hadn't been there in a while.  When we walked...in the front door (early Friday evening), the bar was packed, but there was no one at the host/hostess station at the front to greet the restaurant customers.  That was unusual.  There had always been someone there every other time we went there.  After a few moments, we finally managed to get the attention of one of the inattentive waitresses, who found someone to seat us.  After being seated, it seemed like we waited forever for a waitress to bring us a menu, while they walked back and forth, chatting with each other.  When one finally showed-up, we ordered drinks while perusing yet another new menu, where the prices had been raised again.  My wife remarked that our waitress seemed like she really hated her job because she seemed depressed and didn't smile.  I decided to have the chicken panini, and my wife ordered the nacho appetizer.  We received the food within a reasonable amount of time, and I immediately noticed that the chicken panini was not on panini bread, but regular toast.  The french fries were undercooked, and there was no usual side of coleslaw, which had always been customery there.  I tried eating the sandwich, which was supposed to be grilled, not breaded, and was shocked to discover that it also was undercooked and tasteless.  Hawkeye's used to be well-known for their tasty chicken sandwiches.  When the waitress returned and asked how the meal was, I told her that we had been coming to Hawkeye's for almost 30 years, and that this was the worst meal that I have ever had on Taylor Street.  The waitress apologized and offered to return it to the kitchen for completion or give me something different.  I demurred, told her that it wasn't her fault, and that she did not need to apologize.  I pointed out to her that it was the fault of management and the kitchen.  My wife asked for a container to take the rest her meal home, and the waitress said that she would ask about removing the charge for my sandwich from the bill.  She then took my plate back to the kitchen.  After she left, my wife and I sat there discussing how Hawkeye's had changed for the worst over the last year or so, and how I looked forward to sharing my concerns with the manager.  The waitress returned and gave us the bill with my sandwich charge removed, but we never saw the manager.  I guess he/she just didn't care.  I am really sad and upset that this could happen to a Taylor Street institution.  RIP Hawkeye's.More"

It was about 6:60p and we wanted a place to have a drink and maybe some food. We went into Hawkeye’s Bar & Grill because we had been nibbling on Italian food for a while and it was not crowded.We found the staff friendly and the bar atmosphere good. Their Beer of the month was Miller Lite for $2 Pint. My friend ordered one. I’m not a big fan of lite beer. Our waiter indicated that in honor of Festa Italiana they were offering a draft of Peroni so I had one. Since it was cool inside and we had been walking around for an hour and a half, we decided to order some food. To start we ordered the “hand battered Wisconsin cheese curds”. I CAN NOT recommend this .We received about ¼ pound of curds for $8 and they were over cooked. Very disappointing after the great deal on the beer.We ordered two of the Hawkeye Burgers and two of the Sweet Heat Turkey Burgers. They arrived properly cooked but we could have done just as well most anywhere.Would I go back – probably not."

So which Chicago sandwich shop produces the best pork chop sandwich? What makes a great pork chop sandwich?...Start with a bone-in pork chop. Dredge it lightly in flour and cook it in a healthy amount of oil until it is golden brown and crisply. Then put the tender, juicy pork chop between a steamed bun with a layer of yellow salad mustard and top it with a mountain of grilled Spanish onions and spicy hot sport peppers. One place you can find this iconic sandwich is Jim's Original Hot Dog stand. Located at 1250 South Union Street, at Rochford Street, south of Roosevelt Road, next to the Dan Ryan Expressway, in the University Village and Little Italy neighborhoods, it is an old school hot dog stand that started in 1939 and is open 24 hours a day. Jim's is more widely known for its all-beef hot dog and the first Maxwell Street Polish sausage sandwich, which it introduced in 1943. But old-timers insist that the oldest continuously operating hot dog stand to have once done business on Maxwell Street that Jim's bone-in pork chop sandwich is every bit as good if not better. In fact, the bone-in pork chop sandwich also was invented at Jim's, also in 1943. Other competitors for ""best pork chop sandwich"" include Maxwell Street Depot in Bridgeport and Original Maxwell Street in West Garfield Park.More"

Jim's Original Hot Dog has been selling hot dogs since 1943.  They actually began on Maxwell Street, but when Maxwell Street was re-done, Jim's Original Hot Dog moved over to the 1250 S. Union location.  I remember eating here...while attending the Chicago police academy when it was located here.  Now, all that remains of that time is the street named for the former superintendent.  But, I digress.  This time, we decided to do a taste test and pick up one Polish sausage sandwich from Jim's Original Hot Dog and one Polish sausage sandwich from Express Grill.  We decided to each eat one half and then switch.  So, we found that the Polish sausage was very similar tasting and probably is from the same supplier.  On top of the Polish sausage sandwich were mounds of sweet colossal Spanish onions, two huge sport peppers and a bed of yellow salad mustard on the bun.  We thought that the onions tasted great.  The French fries at Jim's Original Hot Dog were not the crinkle-type, so they didn't seem as crisp as the French fries from Express Grill.  Both sandwiches come with a small bag of French fries and both sandwiches are $5.15 each   Jim's Original Hot Dog is the first of the two hot dog stands on this block of S. Union Ave.  Jim's Original Hot Dog does accept credit cards..More"

Located at 1250 South Union...Avenue, at the southwest corner of Union and James Rochford Street, it started at Maxwell and Halsted but moved to its current location in the wake of the University of Illinois-Chicago's expansion. Jim's claim to fame is the original Maxwell Street Polish Sausage sandwich, which it created in 1943. It features Polish sausage on a hot bun with a layer of yellow salad mustard topped with a mountain of Sweet Colossal Spanish onions and spicy hot sport peppers. With a free order of fries. Honestly, I've never warmed to Polish sausage or brats. But I truly enjoy Jim's cheeseburger with grilled ground beef on a hot bun with yellow mustard, onions, peppers and a slice of American cheese and Jim's filet of fish sandwich with tender whitefish on a hot bun with tartar sauce and onions. My wife prefers the chicken breast sandwich. Imagine, a hot dog stand that isn't noted for its hot dogs. Perhaps that's because Jim's version is a 100 percent beef hot dog with yellow mustard, onions and peppers, not the more celebrated Chicago-style model. Jim's pork chops sandwich also is very popular. Jim's has been in business for 80 years. So he must be doing something right.More"

HORRIBLE! October 18, 2008 We were referred to Rosebud Steakhouse by our concierge at the very exclusive Four Seasons Hotel. ( My goodness when was the last time they had a meal there?) This so called upscale, restaurant was so poor I refuse to give it a 1 star rating. The service is better at Denny's and only if the Denny's was on a subway track.. or football stadium! It was so loud we couldn't hear the waiter or ourselves think! ,It seemed the waiter could care less by his ""cool"" demeanor he didn't feel it necessary to introduce himself If he did who could hear it? The tables have white linens ( big deal) we were crammed in so close to the bar( On a wobbly table I might add) a table in the toilet would have made for a better dining experience. Our meal was served fast ( which proves to me they must have all entrees pre-cooked) and then hurdled out the door like cattle.

It was during the week and snowing and we wanted a restaurant near our hotel, the Palmer House. We found that Rosebud's in the Theatre District was nearby and took the short walk over. It was somewhat quiet inside - not very full at all. However, the service was very friendly and helpful. We were quite hungry after a full day of the audition process and eagerly anticipated our meal. We were not disappointed. We had Caesar salads, bread and wine to begin. For my entree I ordered a Livornese fish dish that was served Mediterranean style with fresh tomatoes, garlic, capers, scallions, kalamata olives and white wine served over soft polenta. The dish was wonderful and unlike any I have had before. My wife enjoyed her meal as did my daughter. A short time after we arrived home I received an email from Rosebud asking about our dining experience and upon responding I received a personal email from the manager thanking me for the comments and explaining in more detail the Livornese dish I had enjoyed so much. All in all a delightful meal with a high level of service. We will definitely go back."

Little Italy is a quiet neighborhood once you get off of Taylor st and wonder around the back streets, nice peaceful park nearby.  UIC sits on Taylor...street so during lunch time the street is lively.  I had a craving for an Italian sub and after walking Taylor street we stopped at this deli.   It is a large mini Italian store with a deli,  plus beer, wine,homemade pastas frozen, cookies, gelato ( only 2 flavors ) and many tables to sit for lunch and eat with the locals.  We decided to share a foot long Mr. Frank.  It was excellent. The bread was fresh, meat, cheese was all great. Prices were also very reasonably probably being next to a University it keeps prices lower.  I’m so happy we decided to jump on a bus and walked around the neighborhood of Little Italy.

Whenever we're in the vicinity, we stop at Conte Di Savoia. Located at 1438 West Taylor Street, two blocks...east of Ashland, it has been serving up delicious sandwiches and salads since 1948. This is an Italian delicatessen that stocks your picnic basket with bread, cheese, salami and wine or a fresh mozzarella sandwich with Italian roasted peppers, does party subs and trays, features Italian specialties and gourmet foods and is home to a large assortment of vintage Italian wines and hard-to-find imported items, pasta, cheese, salumi, coffee and olive oils. Open daily at 9, Conte Di Savoia is our favorite destination for sandwiches while watching special sporting events on TV, like the state high school football playoff or state high school basketball tournament or the World Series or the NCAA basketball tournament or the NCAA football playoff or the Stanley Cup or the NBA finals, even the Kentucky Derby and the Indianapolis 500. Our favorites are three-foot party subs with turkey, provolone, lettuce, tomato and mayo, three-foot French bread sandwiches with ham, salami, capacolla and provolone with lettuce, tomato, and mayo and assorted Italian beef, corned beef, roast beef, pastrami, tuna salad, egg salad and chicken salad sandwiches.

Busy Burger is well within walking distance from the campus, so you'll see a lot of students...coming in.  It is on the northeast corner of May St. & Taylor St.  The interior is decorated quite nicely in a contemporary urban style.  The Busy Burger actually makes me think of a more upscale Five Guys.  The burgers are very good.  We ordered a stuffed beef burger which is a ½ lb. of beef stuffed with BBQ sauce, Wisconsin cheddar and smoked bacon. It was crowned with leaf lettuce, tomato, and onions, and a dill pickle, on a butter toasted bun.  We asked for their spicy sauce to be on the side.  Because it is a stuffed burger, I think it is harder to get to a nice medium rare, so I think that it was closer to well, but still tasty.  We also ordered onion rings which were really good.  The price was right, since we shared the burger.  The staff is very friendly & efficient.  Busy Burger offers free WiFi, as well.  Heed the signs posted for not parking in the bank lot, if you drive there.More"

My son had Lamb curry, which was really good and they were out of what I initially wanted, a kabob thingee, but I got something similar that was right under it. It was like a spicy round patty of minced meat, that was good with the white creamy sauce and bread. I would definitely return and I know my son will patron them often as a UIC student.

Truth be told, we found...both Polish sausages nearly equally good tasting.  The Spanish onions were done just as well.  The sports peppers were a bit smaller than those from Jim's Original Hot Dog.  Now what was different was the French fries.  We thought that the crinkle French fries with a coating of seasonings seemed much crisper than Jim's Original Hot Dog French fries.  The staff was friendly and efficient.  Both sandwiches are $5.15 each and both sandwiches include French fries.  Once you pull up on S. Union Ave., you'll notice Jim's Original Hot Dog first.

In some respects,...they are basically the same.  Order at the window, pay, and eat at the thin counter, or back in your car, or take it home.  The Express Grill has been around for a long time and it seemingly is one of the Chicago area restaurants that just has not changed - ever!  But, that is its charm.  So, the food is pretty good and it certainly fills the need for many of those who work or party, late at night.  The Express Grill is open 24 hours.  So, drive that extra 100 ft. and don't forget to try the Express Grill.  They offer a simple menu and everything comes with sauteed onions and mustard.  There are also free French fries with every sandwich.  We ordered a cheeseburger and a Polish sausage, for lunch, after we had been at Mass.  It was the perfect light lunch.

Original Jim’s is 50 feet north so you can try both a judge for yourself.   These two joints have a long history. Both have been around nearly a hundred years and for some reason...always coexisted next door to each other.   The polish is grilled and served with mustard and grilled onion. Each is served with fries and a side of spicy whole peppers. All this for about $4. Cans and bottles of soda-including some local brands-are available for an extra dollar.   Express grill does take credit cards. They also offer bone in pork chop sandwiches and hotdogs.   I enjoy a Polish from Express Grill every time I’m in town. It’s on my must-do list.   There is no seating but there is a small counter. If it’s raining there is no cover so you eat in the car. If it’s cold you allow the heat from the food and the spicy pepper to warm you up.   It’s in the city so getting there is easy with taxi or Uber but a car is more convenient. Neighborhood is ok but good cheap food attracts all kinds of characters so always worth keeping an eye out for sketchy types.   I’ve been going there for over 30 years so I’m definitely planning on going again next time I’m in town.More

Express Grill,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g35805-d1019877-Reviews-Express_Grill-Chicago_Illinois.html,1-Jan-18,5,Best polish sausage in Chicago ,"Ironically Jim’s Original is more well known for its sausage but the locals prefer Express Grill.   What’s really awesome is that Express grill is only 50 feet south of Jim’s—so if you go to that neighborhood, you can/should try both.   Express Grill sausages are a...little bigger and meatier (less saltier too) and the fries are less seasoned, but better tasting in my opinion than Jim’s.   I’ve been going to Express grill for their classic polish for 31 years. It’s a simple “sandwich” comprised of a smoked polish sausage ( secret recipe) garnished with mustard, grilled onion on a standard hotdog bun and served with two super hot pickled peppers on the side. Always served with fries, it’s the best meal you’ll get for about $4 ( hence the 5 rating).   They also serve hotdogs ( they don’t do it up with all the Chicago style fixins, though —there are other places in Chicago for a classic hotdog) and pork chop sandwiches (bone in). I think you can get a burger and some other stuff too...but I only go for the polish. Local canned soda brands are also offered- try something you otherwise wouldn’t.   It’s open 24/7 365 days per year...that’s right—it never closes The busiest time it seems is 4am-long lines of people waiting to fuel up for the day or get some food in them after partying all night long.   I love this place—I’ve taken business partners, friends and used it as a testing ground for my dates. Regardless of the relationship, If they like it — we can proceed- otherwise we are done !!   A couple things to note:   1. This is a stand. No place to sit. Carry-out, eat in your car or use the sliver of a counter along the wall.  2. This is not a touristy place. The neighborhood is safe but the food brings people from all over and some of them come off as sketchy.  3. Park wherever there is physical space for your car to fit. There are parking meters but in the 31 years I’ve been coming, I never put in a dime.   I don’t care where you from, you’d be missing a classic Chicago street-food  experience if you didn’t visit.   Hope you enjoy it as much as I have.More"

It was was a good and memorable experience. Although crowded, the food was superb, we didn't have to wait on a table, service was prompt and the upstairs dining area was pleasant.  Well, our recent Rosebud experience couldn't have been more opposite. I called two days ahead of time for a reservation. When we arrived, our name was not on the list. Although promptly seated, we were given a table in front of the bar with a blaring TV. The bus boys were very noisy dumping dishes beyond the bar area, I had to send back cold food...the bus boy could not understand what I wanted and instead of sendng the food to be heated, he brought it in a take out box! The lady seated next to us spoke to him in Spanish to get him to understand. I waited 15 minutes before I got my hot food. By that time, my companion had already eaten. The tables were so close together that the server's towel (tucked in the back of her belt) was dragged in my salad as she tried to get between tables to set down food for the next table. I am so sick of TVs in restaurants that I think I will stop eating out. Can't we have a meal in a restaurant without having to watch sports? This meal cost $100 for two people and was worth no more than $40. My advice - STAY AWAY!!!!!!"

Taylor Chicago, IL. A friend who lives in Chicago brought a group of 6 of us there. While the service was slow and badly timed, the food was excellent.When we arrived Sat June 10 about 1PM, the majority of tables were empty.We were given the dinner menu. We ordered 2 family antipasto platters ($8.95 each), delicous and generous but they arrived after a lengthy wait; moments before our meal.The Chopped Salad was delicous and huge ($9.95). It could have been a ""starter"" salad for the entire table of 6! The Veal Parmigiana was meltingly tender and ample ($19.95) The Linguni with Shrimp and Broccoli ($18.95) was good, but the absolute highlight was the Filet Portabella ($29.95). It was tender, flavorful, juicy,.tasty and the red wine sauce was bread-soppingly good. We had to ask for coffe but once it finally came, even the coffee was great. We then had to catch the waiter again and ask for dessert. The desserts were good; the Creme Brulee was delcious, the round cheesecake sliced into 6 pieces was genorous and delicous, Chocolate Mousse Torte was good, the Cannolli good. I don't know what the cookies were in the bar area but they looked yummy. Sadly the waiter did not tell us about them, nor offer us the choice of ordering them. They probably would have been great dipped in the coffee.Our local host said that the Rodsebud at 1500 W Talyor (the one we went to) had the best food of all of the Rosebud's. It's the original one, and we loved the Filet Portabella. It is the BEST steak/flet/beef we have ever tasted! We had heard the beef in the Mid-West was better. The Filet at Rosebud's lived up to all the hoopla of MidWestern beef. Okay, the Filet was so good at Rosebud's we want to know if the dinner can be Fed-Ex'd on dry ice to us in California. (It was even better than the Ribs, Steak and Prime Rib at Carson's Ribs in Chicago.)"

My companion and I each had appetizers, a couple drinks, and featured menu itmes. The veal scallopine and chicken vesuvious are just outstanding, and we had as much to take home with us as we ate at the restaurant.

We ordered our pistachio cannolis and very much enjoyed them in the dining area.  It's a small, not-fancy place,...It is the real thing--no fancy copycat chain franchise.  Nice place to stop in and have a treat.More"

I  navigated to Scafuri before heading to the airport. My daughter and I walked in at 3:50 and the young female clerk was assisting a customer with picking up...a cake. She did not acknowledge our presence during this time. When she was finished, we were about to tell her our order when she said, with a snarky, unwelcoming attitude, ""Just to let you know, we close in 2 minutes"". I replied ""Well, thank you very much"" and turned to leave. I didnt hear another word from her. I would like the owner to know that I would have purchased most of what was left in the bakery case had his employee been willing to actually take my order. I grew up in NY and when I get there or to Chicago, I buy a large quantity of cookies to freeze at home. I wasted my trip to Scafuri and may not have time to make it someplace else before closing time =(More"

Priority Mail and at the time of order that is all I saw to ship.  They were supposed to ship on Tuesday before Easter only 3 hours away... we finally received them Monday after Easter.   Mix...up with post office.  Okay? I emailed a few times because cookies were not being delivered in the 2-3 days promise...  in face we were not going to receive when they were needed Saturday & Easter Sunday.  The owner was nice and refunded the money.  Today we received the cookies.  A few in crumbled but that is not what I am writing about.  The cookies are not good !  Ordered 3 lbs. the butter cookies dipped in chocolate were heavy and larger than normal ... no taste.. they weighed the cookies assortment.  The other butter cookies with sprinkles were tasteless and all irregular sizes.  Cuccidati (fig) cookies were horrible and well as the pignoli cookies which were hard as a rock and presentation very bad.    Thank goodness my money was refunded..  needless to say the cookies went in the garbage.   Here is a pic of the cookies.  Do not order from this company ...  next time we will order from New York.  Huge disappointment !More

Great drink menu too.  They remodeled it a little over a year ago and it looks great.  The food hasn't changed and it's still one of my five favorite sushi joints."
Volcano Sushi Cafe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g35805-d428864-Reviews-Volcano_Sushi_Cafe-Chicago_Illinois.html,9-Jan-17,1,Dreadful service. Not coming here again.,"For some reason, every time I come here the staff seems run off its feet, even when no one is in there (which happens often). The waitstaff never introduces themselves, and orders are often wrong. If you get the all you can eat sushi, they will charge you for anything you don't eat. I saw the manager yelling at some people at another table and I couldn't believe how rude she was. In fact, all the other patrons were kind of blown away at how these patrons were treated- all because they left rice on their plate. It was so unpleasant that I won't go again."

So I decided to try it for dinner. When I saw they had all you can eat sushi and maki for $20.00, that even better. Unfortunately, the experience was disappointing.The service was horrible. Though the place was almost empty, it took a long time to be waited on. I chose an array of maki and sushi. The sushi was fresh, but the maki was bland. The only time the waiter came to my table was when I was looking for him to refresh my beverage.I was excited to try Volcano, but the service was bad and the maki was bland. I will not give this place a second chance."
Volcano Sushi Cafe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g35805-d428864-Reviews-Volcano_Sushi_Cafe-Chicago_Illinois.html,29-Mar-15,2,Go anywhere else!,"With so many better choices in this neighborhood, there is really no reason to go here! They are pricey, service is slow, and they have a policy that if you don't eat every morsel you are served they reserve the right to charge you $1.00 per spoonful of rice left on your plate. Yes this is right! Have you EVER heard of such a policy? Their sushi roll have enormous amount of rice, the ingredients are small, the salmon and mackerel tasted old and REAL fishy, and the choices for the all-you-can-eat are really limited!"
