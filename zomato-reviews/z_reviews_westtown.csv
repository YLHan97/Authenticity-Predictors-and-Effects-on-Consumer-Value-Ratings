Piece,https://www.zomato.com/chicago/piece-wicker-park/reviews,"Jul 14, 2015",3,"I've wanted to check this place out for a long time but never had the time to wait for a table.  When I found out that Hot Doug Sohn was collaborating to make a pizza, I had no choice but to go. A  warning, Piece gets crazy busy on the weekends and there are no reservations.  A table for 2 took a little over 45 minutes, but there is a bar and I had great company so I didn't have any worries.  We got the atomic pizza with chips and dip.  Chips and dip were good not great.  I liked the spinach sauce that came with it but that's not why I came.  The Atomic pizza came with a spicy sausage and pepper jack cheese and while you could tell it's spicy, it was overwhelming.  Maybe I'm just a spicy guy, but I would've liked the heat to be turned up a few notches on an ""atomic"" pizza.  Otherwise, pizza had a good crust and you definitely get a good size pizza for the money.  If you're looking for a Chicago style pizza though you won't find it here as this is New Haven style.  A nice departure from pizza you may have had recently.  It has a bit more chew and it turns out to be more of an oval pizza instead of round.    I didn't even mention that they brew their own beers here.  I was able to try a few styles and I'd definitely recommend the Dunkelweizen, but I imagine they rotate beers so it might not be available right now.

The waitress let me order way too much and we had more than half of the pizza left than we ordered. She obviously was doing it for a tip. She was a little snobby too. But the real problem was that the crust had the taste of the frozen ""home run inn pizza”. You know the sticky kind of glue tasting pizza. The pizza itself was also lacking good construction. It would not even hold together trying to transfer it onto your plate. All the topping just slide right off. My overall grade is 5 out of ten.

I went back early on a Saturday morning and was easily seated. Its easy to see why the place was so popular with all of the beer, and TVs. The pizza didn't look as similar to the real deal with the bright light of day shining in, but looked close enough for me to hold out hope.  There was a lot of flavor in the first bite, and I quickly noticed semolina on the bottom of the crust, which you would never find in New Haven.

Piece,https://www.zomato.com/chicago/piece-wicker-park/reviews,"Dec 14, 2010",0,"Windy City Pizza Club at Piece. I went to Piece on a Sunday night for a 7pm reservation with the Windy City Pizza Club. Originally, we had a group of 22 booked to come; however because of the weather conditions, we had 12. I spoke with a manager a few weeks prior to the reservation and I said that we would like to be at a connected table to make it easier to talk, but the day of they moved us to ""The Pit"".  ""The Pit"" is down some stairs at Piece, where there are a bunch of small circle tables and booth style couches. It wasn't exactly what we needed but we made it work by taking several of the small tables and putting them right up against each other to make a long table, still not convenient, but fun nonetheless. I had fun where we sat as there was a big screen TV and pinball machine, and of course it was more private, but it could use a massive update with its design and Piece décor.   Our waitress was great. I don't expect anything more from a University of Denver alumnus, which she was because she did a fantastic job with our requests, food prep, and check. The service was sometimes a little bit slow but I understood with the weather being so poor that they didn't bring in as many servers. It was also a Sunday night and there were a couple other groups in the Venue.  The Pizza. I won't yet say that it was my favorite, however it is definitely way up in the Top 5 places I have ever been to. I had the red medium half spinach, half artichoke hearts. It was nice to have an inexpensive pizza that had premium toppings. The waitress told us that we had ordered too much for 12 people, as we ordered about 10 different types of Mediums, but in the end, everything was gone. A medium is the right size for 2 people, however there are 12 slices per medium so depends on how big each of your appetites are.  The Beer. I had a great microbrew IPA called ""Cap'n Kickass"" (7.5%). It sort of tastes like Gumball Head, but with less fruitiness and I would recommend it to people that like Pale Ales because it has a good kick to the aftertaste. Overall, I would go back to Piece but not in a group. I really want to try their chocolate pizza and more of their beer selection.

Picollo Sogno,https://www.zomato.com/chicago/piccolo-sogno-river-west/reviews,"Jun 19, 2011",2,"A DISAPPOINTMENT. We looked forward to our lunch at Piccolo Sogno following our son's NWU graduation for a few weeks before coming to Chicago. We had tried for dinner reservations but were told that there was a waiting list for cancellations, and not only a waiting list but a megalist--80 folks were ahead of us on that list. What a fabulous experience this lunch was going to be! (Eighty perople would never be content to wait in Cleveland.). We kept our 2:30 reservations on time and were, of course, wowed by the patio. It is Piccolo Sogno's finest point. From there both service and cuisine slid rapidly downhill. When we asked several questions and one of our party was a bit indecisive after two of us had ordered, our waiter rather bruskly clipped. ""then, I'll be back."" Ten minutes later, we were required to call him back to complete the order. We began our lunch with appetizers--the calamari fitti, squash blossoms and some sort of fresh mozzarella in proscuitto. All three were disappointing--the calamari tender, but not sweet (not the baby calamari the we are used to at Luxe and the Wild Mango in Cleveland), too many tentacles and a bit too salty, the blossoms rathy skimpy and bland and the prosciutto and mozarella, simply uninteresting. Insalata mistas were then served--mixed greens surrounded by three halved grape tomatoes (the skins of mine wrinkled, a sign of waning freshness)--the dressing was a bit on the acidic side--fine for me but my husband could not finish his. The greens were very fresh but the salads most uninteresting--they would be better dubbed ""greens with tomato."" Main courses were again a dissappointment. My husband settled for just having the lentil soup which he said was quite good. I had the green and white noodles with veal ragu--the noodles were wonderful and cooked perfectly al dente but the ragu was thick and heavy and seasoned with a bit too much rosemary (a spice that is best used sapringly with meat dishes--appropriate with a veal ragu but it would not be my choice). Our son was disappointed with his triangular pasta which he commented was overly seasoned with leek and garlic. Our daughter's margareta pizza was tasty but the crust appeared to be a pita or other type flatbread--another disappointement for such a well reviewed restuarant (dare I mention"" Piece"" where pizza is more than king!)--hers was soogy in center causing difficulty cutting. We skipped dessert, took a quick trip to the restroom and left feeling quite glad that we had settled on lunch and not waited thorough the list of 80. I have long believed that the quality of a restuarant can be judged by the ambience of the restrooms. Piccolo Sogno certainly fails in this regard. The ladies room is no match for the patio--it appears to have been overlooked in the gentrification of this site. I'm sorry that the ""dream"" did not come true for our family. While we enjoyed the Arnold Palmers under an umbrella, the rest of the experience was barely a ""B-.""",Jude1104,21469377,16120789,DINING

Picollo Sogno,https://www.zomato.com/chicago/piccolo-sogno-river-west/reviews,"Sep 09, 2009",0,"""Little Dream"" Come True. This weekend, I had the tremendous pleasure of hosting my awesome, Italian through-and-through best friend in this glorious, food-filled city. Since I can't go more than a few days without indulging in Chicago's culinary offerings, I took the liberty of planning her entire trip around eating. And, since she is a fabulous friend, she willingly entertained my need to nosh over doing super touristy things like visiting the John Hancock and Sears (yes, SEARS) Tower.  Friday night, accompanied by one of my favorite chefs of all time (my mom), we visited the acclaimed Piccolo Sogno (464 N. Halsted). Piccolo's buzzworthy patio has dominated every dining publication since the restaurant opened in July 2008, so when the hostess offered us the opportunity to experience the Tuscan escape first hand, no 60 degree evening could stand in my way. Despite my reading and research, I was hardly prepared for the breathtaking oasis of greenery and soft lighting that awaited us.   Completely distracted by the beautiful ambiance of the patio, it took me a good five minutes to even glance at the menu. Our phenomenal server, Jeff, greeted us and quickly proved that his expertise was enough to guide us through our dining adventure- no map (menu) needed. To start, Jeff recommended the antipasto appetizer, a divine collection of wood grilled vegetables (complimented perfectly by the homemade, aged balsamic vinaigrette), house cured meats, and the best Pecorino Romano cheese this side of the Atlantic.   Our appetites whet for more deliciousness, Jeff demanded (seriously, we had no choice) that we sample an appetizer-sized portion of the legendary Ravioli ""Piccolo Sogno"", an exquisite four cheese ravioli served in a butter Marsala glaze with pine nuts and fresh Parmesan shavings. The pasta was sublime, cooked to a perfect al dente. Normally not a fan of Marsala sauce, I was perplexed by the intensity of Executive Chef Tony Priolo's masterpiece. Honestly, I wanted to get a straw and slurp it off the plate, but decided to save my companions the embarrassment by dipping delicious rosemary foccacia bread in it instead (a practice we refer to as ""dinge-ing"" in my family).  To cleanse our palettes, we ordered the Insalata di Pesche (Peaches) and the Insalata special for the evening- shaved artichoke over a bed of baby arugula, dressed in a heavenly lemon oil. It's difficult to imagine that a salad could be so damn good, and consequently we spent the rest of the weekend dissecting the flavors in hopes that my Jersey-Italian BFF could recreate this incredible dish at home (we think we have it figured out!).   After having already sampled so many wonderful dishes, we seriously contemplated our ability (and need, really) to eat dinner. Using my perpetual justification that my brother/roommate could enjoy any leftovers, we dove head first into the entree section of the menu, taking Jeff's spot-on recommendation to order appetizer servings of the Pasta and Risotto specials and the dinner portion of the Veal special. And they were exactly that- special. The pasta, infused with truffles, could have been overpowering and potent, but instead was silky and gratifying. Similarly, the veal was juicy and breaded, the large cut served simply without the distractions of a sauce or glaze. After sampling those two dishes, I barely had room to enjoy my perfectly cooked, incredibly rich vegetable Risotto.  Fulfilling my promise to bring leftovers home meant leaving room for dessert, and Jeff (who was really proving to be a wonderful tour guide) brought us a decadent chocolate and hazelnut cake, paired with a sweet Moscato, that we devoured in a few minutes (okay, seconds).   Completely satisfied and up to our eyeballs in Italian goodness, we waddled our way out of the restaurant and I was extremely grateful at my foresight to wear a loose fitting dress and stretchy leggings to dinner. Our evening at Piccolo Sogno embodied the ultimate five-star dining adventure; beautiful ambiance, wonderful service (Kudos again to Jeff, who is seriously an all-star) and ridiculously delicious food.",GirlThatEats,21060488,16120774,DINING

Perhaps maybe turn the background music up a bit so we can't hear everyones' conversation in nearby tables and add a wider selection of reds by the glass. Other than that, I highly recommend this place. Great experience overall. ",Yosa Yon,30422306,24502777,DINING

Reputable throughout the city for her variations on hot chocolate as well as brunch, we took a chance and walked in to see the wait. Prime time Sunday morning, it would be an hour for two; however, there were two open seats at the bar. We ran for it, almost. I certainly walked over in a quick shuffle. I wanted those seats, and badly. Sitting down, eyes still feeling closed shut from a late night the prior evening, we ordered two coffees. Given the name of the restaurant, we looked at each other and without having to say much took a quick gaze at the menu to see what hot chocolate we would also do. I ordered the malted vanilla, a 100% pure “Opylus” white chocolate, malt, and vanilla. The hot chocolate was topped with homemade marshmallows. One of my favorite things about sitting at the bar is you get to meet new people, whether it be the bartender or your next-door neighbor. Next to us, a young gentleman braved an egg plate and the buttermilk pancake. Starving, I couldn’t keep my eyes off of this decadent plate, topped with whipped hot fudge butter, sliced banana and Burton’s maple syrup. We were told the pancake is baked in a skillet, hence its large circular nature. The guy must have read my facial expression of wanting to sample the pancake and as he was leaving stated we should give it a sample as there was no way he’d finish it with over half left. Generally, I wouldn’t do it but we had become buds throughout the course of our brunch meals and I figured, why not. I did cut from the uneaten side though. Soon after, my plate arrived. The Brioche French Toast with lemon curd whipped cream and rhubarb & local preserved strawberry compote. The plate was accompanied with a house made sausage. Never before had I seen a French toast paired with a savory. I embraced it and even combined the two, loving the co",Elizabeth H,23673614,23645133,DINING

However the rest of the food there is unimpressive. The crab cake was OK but all I could taste was the remoulade. The mac and cheese is marginally better than Kraft and is served warm as many other reviews have noted. All of this is probably not going to dissuade anyone from dining here as everyone just comes for the dessert...  Sadly the dessert is equally as pedestrian as the rest of the menu. The donuts have a texture and consistency between a store bought donut and a dinner biscuit (the chocolate sauce doesn't help.)

Seriously, one of the best burgers I've ever tasted! Another friend raved about the Arctic Char and lastly the Duck was also amazingly tender.

I found them lacking in flavor a bit, and it needed to be a little sweeter than it was. It's probably perfect for those who barely have a sweet tooth but I like a stronger flavor, either more cream cheese or more sugar.

Bongo Room,https://www.zomato.com/chicago/the-bongo-room-wicker-park/reviews,"Apr 22, 2015",4,"The Bongo Room has been on my Chicago food bucket list for several years now so my husband and I decided that it was time to finally check it off. We woke up early on a Sunday morning and headed to their Wicker Park location. They also have locations in Andersonville and the South Loop (no alcoholic beverages in the South Loop) and all locations open at 9am on Saturdays and Sundays. We arrived around 8:45am and there was already a line forming out front. By the time the doors opened the line was down the block and by 9:10am every seat in the restaurant was full. Moral of the story - get there early or be prepared for a long wait!  Before I arrived I already knew one of my must-orders, the White Chocolate Caramel Pretzel Pancakes. These aren't on the menu but they're one of The Bongo Room's most popular items, and now I know why. These giant, plate-sized pancakes are completely drenched in the white chocolate and caramel topping and all I can say is Wow. I don't even like white chocolate, but these pancakes were ridiculously good. They offer a half order so you can have just one pancake if you want to try a few different things, but my guess is you'll be wishing you had the whole stack - I know I did. I've also heard that the Red Velvet pancakes, another off-menu item, are pretty fantastic as well.  My husband and I shared the pancakes and also ordered a couple of the savory menu items. He went for the Chorizo Potato Avocado Omelette and I tried the Deconstructed Lobster Roll Benedict. Like the pancakes, both were huge portions and very good. If you're a fan of avocado and chorizo, this omelet is totally stuffed with both. The Eggs Benedict was topped with a green goddess hollandaise that was a really delicious twist on one of my favorites. The buttery buns beneath the eggs could have been a bit more fresh, but I was still happy with my choice. Both of these dishes came with a side of The Bongo Room's House Potatoes that were really great as well.  My recommendation - don't miss the sweeter side of things at The Bongo Room. Red velvet pancakes, chocolate French toast, white chocolate caramel pretzel pancakes...they're all winners and they're what makes The Bongo Room extra special. I'm usually more of a savory breakfast girl myself but this is where I will make the exception.

They aren’t crowded and the weather is cool without being cold. This is the time of year when the tourists have left, and Chicagoans reclaim the city. Last week Charles and I finally went to The Smoke Daddy, one of Chicago’s most well known barbecue restaurants. It was a perfect fall evening, and it was so nice to take a break from writing the cookbook.  To be honest, I was trying my best to be in date night mode, instead of blogger mode that evening. It is easy to get wrapped up by the constant buzzing from Instagram, Twitter, Gmail, and WordPress on my phone. It can be hard to get my undivided attention. I was trying to be a decent blogger while still being a decent date. Running into our friend, who sat at the next table, made it easy for me to sneak in a couple minutes of blogger time. I was trying to be quick, and for that reason, I didn’t go into the restaurant! I can’t tell you anything about the interior. I can tell you that there are two beautiful outdoor spaces, the sidewalk patio and the open bar area. Both were busy without being crowded and the atmosphere was very relaxing.  I can also let you know that the food is some of the best barbecue I have had in Chicago. Charles had the Louisiana style ribs which were fall off the bone tender. They practically melted in your mouth. You have a choice of three barbecue sauces, a sweet, a spicy and the traditional. I tend to like barbecue sauces that have vinegar, but these were quite good. Charles had smoked beans on the side, which is something I would have never picked, but now that I have tried them I would certainly order them again. They have a deep smokey flavor. It was a unique side dish that paired well with the ribs.  I had the pulled pork sandwich and a side of mac and cheese. It was a considerable amount of food, especially considering the fact that it cost less than $10. The pork sandwich was huge. The pork was shredded and drown in the traditional barbecue sauce. It was fantastic. The mac and cheese might be the best in Chicago. It was very creamy and obviously very cheesy. It is a great take on a classic homestyle mac and cheese. I highly recommend you try it.  The Smoke Daddy is located at 1804 W Division Street in Chicago. The atmosphere is casual and the food is inexpensive.

I love the amount of great restaurants and bars that I can immediately walk into in Chicago. That's why I was so surprised when arriving at the Violet Hour, there was a bit of a line out the door. Now, I can't remember the last time I waited in line to get into a place. I wasn't too worried. The line wasn't that long... wow, was I wrong. After waiting an hour, inching my way into the front door, only four more people in front of us, I saw a rule list posted on the wall. Some of the rules included, must have proper attire, do not order beer, do not order grey goose, no reservations. Weird. After investing a full hour of my life waiting in line I was determined to wait a little longer to see what this was all about. The place was at full capacity, meaning the only way the line would move forward was if someone left the club. The guy in front of me said "" this place better have freaking cherubs servings drinks in there!""... My thoughts exactly. Well, there was no way we were getting in anytime soon. Suddenly, at the hour of 10 pm there were about three groups of 4 to 5 girls walking right past the line, saying to the doorman, ""we have reservations."" I was shocked. Right next to me there was a rule list that stated 'no reservations'. And to my doubled shock the door man let them in!! Suddenly, I went from having only four people in front of me to having twenty people in front of me! I turned to my date and said, ""lets get out of here."" We promptly left the line, walked into a hoppin' bar half a block away and ordered ourselves two grey gooses, straight up. It was great.

Found beneath the tracks of the Blue Line on Damen and toqued by Chef de Cuisine Tom Carlin, the idea of counter-service Mexican fare in a hip setting plus plenty of Mezcal following Kahan’s mega-successful Big Star, it was bellied up to the Bar that a sleepy-eyed Woman offered greetings, Coffee plus a menu, high heat and humidity welcoming only two of three with Ice Water quickly poured and a two-course order to follow.  Disappointed to be visiting Dove’s alone, an expansive menu that changes slightly at noon offering no shortage of temptation, it was while 70s and 80s tunes played overhead that line cooks were watched firing plates at breakneck pace, everything prepared with great care, timing and cleanliness despite close quarters.  Trending mostly savory, Enchiladas and Hash both evidently popular, it was after a menu-described fifteen minutes that scalding cast iron was presented alongside fried Chicken soaked in thick Gravy, Peas and Onions, each ingredient equally prominent across the palate to form one of the most ‘rib-sticking’ dishes in recent memory while the Pancake was best along the edges where Maple Syrup had concentrated and caramelized, though the center was also pleasant thanks to bursting Berries and tangy Crema.

Antique Taco,https://www.zomato.com/chicago/antique-taco-wicker-park/reviews,"Apr 08, 2015",4,"An Ode to Fried Cheese Curds. I am a Chicago transplant. I grew up in Maine, a place where cheese isn’t fried and no one knows what a cheese curd is. The word “curd” bothers me. It isn’t appealing. It doesn’t sound like something I want to eat. For that reason, I lived in Chicago – just a stones throw from Wisconsin, the land of the cheese heads – for a few years before I even tried a cheese curd. Now I order them all the time.  Tuesday night my friends Anne, Alexis and I tried an entirely different style of fried cheese curds at Antique Taco: Beer Battered Cheese Curds with Chorizo Chili, Crema Fresca, and Scallions. It piqued our interest and we had to try them. I hadn’t seen fried cheese curds combined with chili before, but it is a brilliant idea. The spiciness of the chili paired perfectly with the mellow and melty fried cheese curds. The size of the dish welcomed sharing, it was just right as an appetizer for three, and it was fun to eat. I loved schmearing chili and crema all over the curds. It was crunchy, creamy, and spicy all together, and certainly something I will order next time I visit Antique Taco.

PICCOLO SOGNO DUE,https://www.zomato.com/chicago/piccolo-sogno-river-west/reviews,"Jun 19, 2011",2,"A DISAPPOINTMENT. We looked forward to our lunch at Piccolo Sogno following our son's NWU graduation for a few weeks before coming to Chicago. We had tried for dinner reservations but were told that there was a waiting list for cancellations, and not only a waiting list but a megalist--80 folks were ahead of us on that list. What a fabulous experience this lunch was going to be! (Eighty perople would never be content to wait in Cleveland.). We kept our 2:30 reservations on time and were, of course, wowed by the patio. It is Piccolo Sogno's finest point. From there both service and cuisine slid rapidly downhill. When we asked several questions and one of our party was a bit indecisive after two of us had ordered, our waiter rather bruskly clipped. ""then, I'll be back."" Ten minutes later, we were required to call him back to complete the order. We began our lunch with appetizers--the calamari fitti, squash blossoms and some sort of fresh mozzarella in proscuitto. All three were disappointing--the calamari tender, but not sweet (not the baby calamari the we are used to at Luxe and the Wild Mango in Cleveland), too many tentacles and a bit too salty, the blossoms rathy skimpy and bland and the prosciutto and mozarella, simply uninteresting. Insalata mistas were then served--mixed greens surrounded by three halved grape tomatoes (the skins of mine wrinkled, a sign of waning freshness)--the dressing was a bit on the acidic side--fine for me but my husband could not finish his. The greens were very fresh but the salads most uninteresting--they would be better dubbed ""greens with tomato."" Main courses were again a dissappointment. My husband settled for just having the lentil soup which he said was quite good. I had the green and white noodles with veal ragu--the noodles were wonderful and cooked perfectly al dente but the ragu was thick and heavy and seasoned with a bit too much rosemary (a spice that is best used sapringly with meat dishes--appropriate with a veal ragu but it would not be my choice). Our son was disappointed with his triangular pasta which he commented was overly seasoned with leek and garlic. Our daughter's margareta pizza was tasty but the crust appeared to be a pita or other type flatbread--another disappointement for such a well reviewed restuarant (dare I mention"" Piece"" where pizza is more than king!)--hers was soogy in center causing difficulty cutting. We skipped dessert, took a quick trip to the restroom and left feeling quite glad that we had settled on lunch and not waited thorough the list of 80. I have long believed that the quality of a restuarant can be judged by the ambience of the restrooms. Piccolo Sogno certainly fails in this regard. The ladies room is no match for the patio--it appears to have been overlooked in the gentrification of this site. I'm sorry that the ""dream"" did not come true for our family. While we enjoyed the Arnold Palmers under an umbrella, the rest of the experience was barely a ""B-.""",Jude1104,21469377,16120789,DINING

PICCOLO SOGNO DUE,https://www.zomato.com/chicago/piccolo-sogno-river-west/reviews,"Sep 09, 2009",0,"""Little Dream"" Come True. This weekend, I had the tremendous pleasure of hosting my awesome, Italian through-and-through best friend in this glorious, food-filled city. Since I can't go more than a few days without indulging in Chicago's culinary offerings, I took the liberty of planning her entire trip around eating. And, since she is a fabulous friend, she willingly entertained my need to nosh over doing super touristy things like visiting the John Hancock and Sears (yes, SEARS) Tower.  Friday night, accompanied by one of my favorite chefs of all time (my mom), we visited the acclaimed Piccolo Sogno (464 N. Halsted). Piccolo's buzzworthy patio has dominated every dining publication since the restaurant opened in July 2008, so when the hostess offered us the opportunity to experience the Tuscan escape first hand, no 60 degree evening could stand in my way. Despite my reading and research, I was hardly prepared for the breathtaking oasis of greenery and soft lighting that awaited us.   Completely distracted by the beautiful ambiance of the patio, it took me a good five minutes to even glance at the menu. Our phenomenal server, Jeff, greeted us and quickly proved that his expertise was enough to guide us through our dining adventure- no map (menu) needed. To start, Jeff recommended the antipasto appetizer, a divine collection of wood grilled vegetables (complimented perfectly by the homemade, aged balsamic vinaigrette), house cured meats, and the best Pecorino Romano cheese this side of the Atlantic.   Our appetites whet for more deliciousness, Jeff demanded (seriously, we had no choice) that we sample an appetizer-sized portion of the legendary Ravioli ""Piccolo Sogno"", an exquisite four cheese ravioli served in a butter Marsala glaze with pine nuts and fresh Parmesan shavings. The pasta was sublime, cooked to a perfect al dente. Normally not a fan of Marsala sauce, I was perplexed by the intensity of Executive Chef Tony Priolo's masterpiece. Honestly, I wanted to get a straw and slurp it off the plate, but decided to save my companions the embarrassment by dipping delicious rosemary foccacia bread in it instead (a practice we refer to as ""dinge-ing"" in my family).  To cleanse our palettes, we ordered the Insalata di Pesche (Peaches) and the Insalata special for the evening- shaved artichoke over a bed of baby arugula, dressed in a heavenly lemon oil. It's difficult to imagine that a salad could be so damn good, and consequently we spent the rest of the weekend dissecting the flavors in hopes that my Jersey-Italian BFF could recreate this incredible dish at home (we think we have it figured out!).   After having already sampled so many wonderful dishes, we seriously contemplated our ability (and need, really) to eat dinner. Using my perpetual justification that my brother/roommate could enjoy any leftovers, we dove head first into the entree section of the menu, taking Jeff's spot-on recommendation to order appetizer servings of the Pasta and Risotto specials and the dinner portion of the Veal special. And they were exactly that- special. The pasta, infused with truffles, could have been overpowering and potent, but instead was silky and gratifying. Similarly, the veal was juicy and breaded, the large cut served simply without the distractions of a sauce or glaze. After sampling those two dishes, I barely had room to enjoy my perfectly cooked, incredibly rich vegetable Risotto.  Fulfilling my promise to bring leftovers home meant leaving room for dessert, and Jeff (who was really proving to be a wonderful tour guide) brought us a decadent chocolate and hazelnut cake, paired with a sweet Moscato, that we devoured in a few minutes (okay, seconds).   Completely satisfied and up to our eyeballs in Italian goodness, we waddled our way out of the restaurant and I was extremely grateful at my foresight to wear a loose fitting dress and stretchy leggings to dinner. Our evening at Piccolo Sogno embodied the ultimate five-star dining adventure; beautiful ambiance, wonderful service (Kudos again to Jeff, who is seriously an all-star) and ridiculously delicious food.",GirlThatEats,21060488,16120774,DINING

Nando Milano Trattoria,https://www.zomato.com/chicago/nando-milano-trattoria-wicker-park/reviews,"May 01, 2015",4.5,"Innamorati del tartufo… Fall in love with truffles. While I don’t need any enticement to enjoy the fragrant earthy bulbs, I take every opportunity to be reminded of how delicious they really are. My most recent experience with Italian truffles was at the hand of Chef Alessio Vullo of Nando Milano Trattoria.  My love affair with Nando Milano is ongoing. I fell for the place hard and fast during an epic five-hour ladies lunch one September day. I have been a regular ever since. Countless Aperol spritzers, limoncello shots and delicious pastas later, I am just as enamored with the place as I was that first day. Nando’s charm just doesn’t wear out. Could it be the handsome Italians, who embrace me every time I cross the threshold? Perhaps. And the food, the delicious food, well, it has a lot to do with it.  Nando Milano recently celebrated truffle season by running weekly specials generously adorned with fragrant shavings of black truffles from Piedmont (and if you asked nicely, white truffles). This month long event was called, what else? “Innamorati Del Tartufo.” And fall in love with truffles I did. All over again. Just look at my truffle journey.  A souffle of artichoke-squash-parmesan cheese puree came with creamy saffron-porcini sauce, crispy leeks and topped with a generous helping of black truffle slices. An interpretation of Chef’s family recipe, this was an unusual combination of flavors and textures. Turns out artichoke’s green notes go wonderfully with the earthiness of truffles.  Crispy polenta with portobello mushrooms, cheese fondue and porcini sauce supported black truffle slices without overpowering the delicate texture and aroma. The polenta was a perfect canvas for the star of this show. A flavor rich start to any truffle infused meal.  One of my favorite ways to use truffles is in combination with eggs. Creamy unctuous yolks and earthy pungent truffles are a perfect marriage in my book. Lucky for me, Chef Alessio agrees. Though not on the actual menu, at my request the chef sent out a simple sunny side up egg topped with good amount of fragrant black slices. Heavenly. Perfection, my friends, requires no embellishment.  The dish, however, that blew me away at the end of my truffle journey, were the pillowy light house made gnocchi in simple sage butter. At my request, it came topped with white truffle slices, creating the ultimate plate of decadence. Chef Alessio’s hand-made pastas are wonderful on their own. However, topped with luxurious white truffles, the ethereal gnocchi became a study in savory indulgence.  Truffle season is coming to a close, and I am sad that it is. I have plenty of delicious memories to start looking forward to the next season. You, however, don’t have to wait that long. It’s the holiday season after all, and Chef Alessio has a gift waiting for you at Nando Milano. His white truffle risotto is making an appearance on the New Year’s Eve Celebration menu. Hurry up an book your reservation now and fall in love all over again! The truffles are waiting.  {This review was originally published on December 26th, 2013}  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  There are days when I work really hard. Most days, in fact. And then there are the afternoons spent on the Italian job. It’s hard work, but someone has to do it, and I am a team player. I will always take one for the team. There are many advantages to the Italian job: Aperol spritzers, hand made pastas and handsome Italian men. “Amore mio, Bellissima! I have been waiting my whole life just for you!” This maybe an exaggeration, but uttered with such sincerity, you want to believe it. Generally, such an Italian job is found, where else? in Italy. However, I have recently discovered a little spicy meatball of Italian place right here in Chicago’s Wicker Park neighborhood. On the patio of Nando Milano Trattoria, the spritzers are ice cold, the food delicious and the hot Italian men? Well, they are easy on the eyes. This, my friends, is the five-hour lunch territory. Time flies when you are having fun and drinking Italian wine.  When a good friend suggested we have a week day lunch at Nando Milano, I was not at all ready for the way my afternoon unfolded. I was prepared for a session of great girl talk, some delicious Italian fare, maybe a cocktail or two. The following five hours became a blur of dishes and drinks and flirtatious remarks as Nando Milano embraced three ladies that lunch. Aperol spritzers gave way to prosecco and wine. Cocktails made their way to our table in a parade of flavors and colors at the whim of the handsome Dario (one of the most charming men I have ever encountered, the owner of Nando Milano). It didn’t matter what we ordered or did not order, things appeared table side with impressive consistency and ease, while we basked in the late September sun.  The wine list at Nando Milano is lovely and paired beautifully to the rustic Italian fare being served here. Prosecco, falanghina and valpolicella all make their appearances during lunch. However, the cocktails deserve your attention. “Have you ever had a negroni made by an Italian? No?! Bellissima, you have never had a negroni!” Magically, three of them appear as if from thin air. I have to tell you, negronis made by an Italian? Pretty damn delicious. Prosecco cocktail with muddled fresh strawberries and mint is delicately sweet and refreshing, just begging to be enjoyed with brunch. Aperol spritzers are made to evoke the memories of summers in Rome. Espresso martinis are dark and brooding, redolent of real Italian espresso and garnished with whole espresso beans. “This is a grown up cup of coffee, Bellissima!” The Nando signature cocktail arrives looking like an Italian flag, with scoops of lemon granita camouflaging a substantial amount of alcohol. Not to be missed is the house made limoncello, thick and smooth, rich with lemons, reminiscent of Sicilian sunshine. To answer your inevitable question: yes, we sampled them all. On a week day. At lunch. I told you I work hard! It’s the Italian job!  My affinity for great Italian food is well documented. The food at Nando Milano does not disappoint. The fare here is simple and decidedly unfussy. Beautiful locally produced burrata (Dario would not reveal his source, only that it’s made in Wisconsin) steals the show as part of a simple caprese salad. Melon, weeping with sugar sweet juices, comes draped in salty prosciutto slices so thin, they are translucent. Arancini comes oversized, evoking a good amount of inappropriate jokes, but as I cut into it, it is audibly crunchy on the outside, oozy and sensually soft on the inside.  What really melts my heart here is the pasta. Hand made daily, the pasta is achingly fresh, and comes barely adorned with other ingredients. Make no mistake: pasta is the star in your bowl. As is my habit, I ordered two of the most simple preparations. Spaghetti with black pepper and ricotta is a creamy tangle, smooth and unctuous, punctuated by bursts of heat. My favorite dish of the day, though, is the linguine with guanciale, onions and spicy tomato sauce. Perfect with a glass of valpolicella.  Our meal concludes with a slew of desserts. Much lauded tiramisu is very creamy and air-light and delicious. But the lemon granita, refreshing and cool and tart, suits me just fine.  I work hard most days and the Italian job has to be done. My new friend Dario kisses both of my cheeks as we say farewell. “Ciao, Bellissima! When will I see you again?” I promise to return. As I walk away, albeit not that steadily, I feel that late September sun on my face and I am instantly transported to Sicily. I think of flavors and colors and aromas I have experienced in the last few hours. Yes, indeed, the Italian job has to be done. Can I have some volunteers?  {This review was originally published on December 25th, 2013}",Gourmet Rambler,27887829,23559341,DINING

Club Lucky,https://www.zomato.com/chicago/club-lucky-wicker-park/reviews,"May 01, 2015",4.5,"Innamorati del tartufo… Fall in love with truffles. While I don’t need any enticement to enjoy the fragrant earthy bulbs, I take every opportunity to be reminded of how delicious they really are. My most recent experience with Italian truffles was at the hand of Chef Alessio Vullo of Nando Milano Trattoria.  My love affair with Nando Milano is ongoing. I fell for the place hard and fast during an epic five-hour ladies lunch one September day. I have been a regular ever since. Countless Aperol spritzers, limoncello shots and delicious pastas later, I am just as enamored with the place as I was that first day. Nando’s charm just doesn’t wear out. Could it be the handsome Italians, who embrace me every time I cross the threshold? Perhaps. And the food, the delicious food, well, it has a lot to do with it.  Nando Milano recently celebrated truffle season by running weekly specials generously adorned with fragrant shavings of black truffles from Piedmont (and if you asked nicely, white truffles). This month long event was called, what else? “Innamorati Del Tartufo.” And fall in love with truffles I did. All over again. Just look at my truffle journey.  A souffle of artichoke-squash-parmesan cheese puree came with creamy saffron-porcini sauce, crispy leeks and topped with a generous helping of black truffle slices. An interpretation of Chef’s family recipe, this was an unusual combination of flavors and textures. Turns out artichoke’s green notes go wonderfully with the earthiness of truffles.  Crispy polenta with portobello mushrooms, cheese fondue and porcini sauce supported black truffle slices without overpowering the delicate texture and aroma. The polenta was a perfect canvas for the star of this show. A flavor rich start to any truffle infused meal.  One of my favorite ways to use truffles is in combination with eggs. Creamy unctuous yolks and earthy pungent truffles are a perfect marriage in my book. Lucky for me, Chef Alessio agrees. Though not on the actual menu, at my request the chef sent out a simple sunny side up egg topped with good amount of fragrant black slices. Heavenly. Perfection, my friends, requires no embellishment.  The dish, however, that blew me away at the end of my truffle journey, were the pillowy light house made gnocchi in simple sage butter. At my request, it came topped with white truffle slices, creating the ultimate plate of decadence. Chef Alessio’s hand-made pastas are wonderful on their own. However, topped with luxurious white truffles, the ethereal gnocchi became a study in savory indulgence.  Truffle season is coming to a close, and I am sad that it is. I have plenty of delicious memories to start looking forward to the next season. You, however, don’t have to wait that long. It’s the holiday season after all, and Chef Alessio has a gift waiting for you at Nando Milano. His white truffle risotto is making an appearance on the New Year’s Eve Celebration menu. Hurry up an book your reservation now and fall in love all over again! The truffles are waiting.  {This review was originally published on December 26th, 2013}  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  There are days when I work really hard. Most days, in fact. And then there are the afternoons spent on the Italian job. It’s hard work, but someone has to do it, and I am a team player. I will always take one for the team. There are many advantages to the Italian job: Aperol spritzers, hand made pastas and handsome Italian men. “Amore mio, Bellissima! I have been waiting my whole life just for you!” This maybe an exaggeration, but uttered with such sincerity, you want to believe it. Generally, such an Italian job is found, where else? in Italy. However, I have recently discovered a little spicy meatball of Italian place right here in Chicago’s Wicker Park neighborhood. On the patio of Nando Milano Trattoria, the spritzers are ice cold, the food delicious and the hot Italian men? Well, they are easy on the eyes. This, my friends, is the five-hour lunch territory. Time flies when you are having fun and drinking Italian wine.  When a good friend suggested we have a week day lunch at Nando Milano, I was not at all ready for the way my afternoon unfolded. I was prepared for a session of great girl talk, some delicious Italian fare, maybe a cocktail or two. The following five hours became a blur of dishes and drinks and flirtatious remarks as Nando Milano embraced three ladies that lunch. Aperol spritzers gave way to prosecco and wine. Cocktails made their way to our table in a parade of flavors and colors at the whim of the handsome Dario (one of the most charming men I have ever encountered, the owner of Nando Milano). It didn’t matter what we ordered or did not order, things appeared table side with impressive consistency and ease, while we basked in the late September sun.  The wine list at Nando Milano is lovely and paired beautifully to the rustic Italian fare being served here. Prosecco, falanghina and valpolicella all make their appearances during lunch. However, the cocktails deserve your attention. “Have you ever had a negroni made by an Italian? No?! Bellissima, you have never had a negroni!” Magically, three of them appear as if from thin air. I have to tell you, negronis made by an Italian? Pretty damn delicious. Prosecco cocktail with muddled fresh strawberries and mint is delicately sweet and refreshing, just begging to be enjoyed with brunch. Aperol spritzers are made to evoke the memories of summers in Rome. Espresso martinis are dark and brooding, redolent of real Italian espresso and garnished with whole espresso beans. “This is a grown up cup of coffee, Bellissima!” The Nando signature cocktail arrives looking like an Italian flag, with scoops of lemon granita camouflaging a substantial amount of alcohol. Not to be missed is the house made limoncello, thick and smooth, rich with lemons, reminiscent of Sicilian sunshine. To answer your inevitable question: yes, we sampled them all. On a week day. At lunch. I told you I work hard! It’s the Italian job!  My affinity for great Italian food is well documented. The food at Nando Milano does not disappoint. The fare here is simple and decidedly unfussy. Beautiful locally produced burrata (Dario would not reveal his source, only that it’s made in Wisconsin) steals the show as part of a simple caprese salad. Melon, weeping with sugar sweet juices, comes draped in salty prosciutto slices so thin, they are translucent. Arancini comes oversized, evoking a good amount of inappropriate jokes, but as I cut into it, it is audibly crunchy on the outside, oozy and sensually soft on the inside.  What really melts my heart here is the pasta. Hand made daily, the pasta is achingly fresh, and comes barely adorned with other ingredients. Make no mistake: pasta is the star in your bowl. As is my habit, I ordered two of the most simple preparations. Spaghetti with black pepper and ricotta is a creamy tangle, smooth and unctuous, punctuated by bursts of heat. My favorite dish of the day, though, is the linguine with guanciale, onions and spicy tomato sauce. Perfect with a glass of valpolicella.  Our meal concludes with a slew of desserts. Much lauded tiramisu is very creamy and air-light and delicious. But the lemon granita, refreshing and cool and tart, suits me just fine.  I work hard most days and the Italian job has to be done. My new friend Dario kisses both of my cheeks as we say farewell. “Ciao, Bellissima! When will I see you again?” I promise to return. As I walk away, albeit not that steadily, I feel that late September sun on my face and I am instantly transported to Sicily. I think of flavors and colors and aromas I have experienced in the last few hours. Yes, indeed, the Italian job has to be done. Can I have some volunteers?  {This review was originally published on December 25th, 2013}",Gourmet Rambler,27887829,23559341,DINING

But, I've been meaning to visit this place for awhile and my mom was paying, so like why not.  This place would make your average every day hipster blush.

The sizes of the dishes were small, so better order different dishes and share between friends.   The Escolar Pearls(4p) was like mini nigiri with escolar sashimi and truffle oil. Soft sushi rice was perfectly bonded with fatty fish meat and fragrant truffle smell, so good!   Karaage fried chicken was not that impressive. The sweet potato skin was really crunchy and flaky but the chicken was too salty and oily.  Dynamite mussels was ok. Love the creamy negi mayo but the mussel was not as tasty as I expected.  The sushi rolls we order: angry crab, orange rush, flaming tuna and green monster were all exceptional! The combination of the fresh fish ingredients,topping and sauce were really nice, highly recommended!   The special dishes we ordered were toro tuna and mushroom salad; crispy soft shell crab wrapped in cucumber. Those dishes were also great! The freshness of the mushroom, salad leaves and citrus dressing help ease the fatty in the tuna meat, balance perfectly. Same as the soft shell crab.   However, the charbroil skewers were just ok. The dessert was just average too. But if u want, still can have a try.   Kai Zan offer omakase( chef's choice) as well. If u really love sushi, have a go.

Obviously, doing helps to expand the geographic reach of my blog, but it also paints a clear picture of different trends in the cuisine. Over time, I've noticed that while different cities may have a similar appetite for premium sushi restaurants, their style is far from the same. Take for example Seattle, where sustainable sushi is a key feature at Sushi Mishiko. Or in New York City, where traditional omakase (with famous sushi chefs) are what stands out at places like Ichimura or Nakazawa. Or in Miami, at Naoe (which I always find a way to sneak in to a blog post), which trumpets the fish flown in daily from Japan. In Chicago, I made a point to visit the strongly reviewed - and recently opened - Kai Zan. The style of Kai Zan is hard to describe, but for the purposes of this blog post, we'll refer to it as ""fusion"". It's not typical asian fusion however - it marries traditional omakase (think: nigiri and fresh fish unencumbered by excessive sauces or weird pairings) with tapas style small plates. There isn't breaded chicken or the like - everything is relatively similar to how it was caught, and everything is unique.  The food  is prepared strictly behind the sushi bar, where the grill and open concept kitchen meld perfectly into the sushi preparation area. The twin brothers who own the place both work behind the bar, and both try to make their presence known throughout your meal, which is what a customer always prefers from chef/owners. I tried to sample as diverse a menu as possible, while acquiescing to the server's suggestions. The maguro pearls were unique, almost like mini nigiri (pictured right). I also tried the Uni shooter, which was the only menu option that let me down on account of a bit too much citrus.  I also self-selected a ""mini-omakase"" of a variety of nigiri.

The only downside to the night was that our server was pretty unfriendly and made us feel uncomfortable... don't expect warm service. The angry-angsty server situation is the only thing that prevents me from giving them 5 stars. Still, the uni toro dish alone makes it worth the trip out to West Town.

The crust was burnt, but not overly burnt...just right.   At Coalfire, they find the right amount of cheese, and fresh ingredients and put it together so that nothing is over bearing on the taste buds. Not only was the Pizza good, the service was awesome. Our waitress, Amy (I think that was her name) was on top of her game and the owners were nice. The atmosphere, though did not have any TV's, was cool with a lot of sweet artwork.   If I had to change anything, I would not charge extra for fresh mozzarella and probably not let people take out because of the high moisture content of the pizza.

Start off with a Bloody Mary or another boozy beverage from their bar, like one of the half-dozen or more flavored mimosas. The ever-wicked Chile Verde Bloody Mary ($8) requires the mandatory Miller Pony as a kickback to cool the burn.

Flo,https://www.zomato.com/chicago/flo-west-town/reviews,"Apr 08, 2015",4.5,"Chicago Restaurant Spotlight: Flo. Spring arrived in Chicago on Saturday (and then promptly left again, but that is another story). Saturday was a sunny 70 degree day, so instead of lounging around at home cooking breakfast in my pajamas, we decided to go out for brunch. Charles suggested that we go to Flo, a Mexican restaurant in West Town, where we went on one of our first dates. We hadn’t been to Flo in years – it somehow slipped off of our radar; finally returning an old date spot was a special treat.  Flo was just as we remembered it. It is a casual restaurant with a laid back vibe. There is usually a crowd of people waiting outside for tables. Free coffee is available while you wait, giving diners an extra incentive to patiently wait for a table. It was such a nice day that the wait flew right by.  The menu has several different breakfast cocktails, but I went for a mimosa since it sounded refreshing. We shared the chips and guacamole to start, because when you have brunch after noon, ordering an appetizer just makes sense. The chips are freshly made in house, and the guacamole is full of big chunks of avocado.  I had the huevos rancheros, while Charles had a gigantic Smothered Ranchero Burrito with potatoes. I love the simplicity of huevos rancheros. In it’s most basic form, huevos ranchers consists of tortillas, red chili sauce, black beans, and fried eggs. Often the dish incorporates rice, cheese, and/or guacamole. At Flo the huevos rancheros begins with cheese stuffed tortillas, which are smothered with red chili sauce, and then topped with fried eggs with runny yolks. Black beans, pico de gallo, and extra tortillas are served on the side. This is the ultimate breakfast (especially if you indulged in a few beverages the night before) – it is cheesy, spicy, and packed with protein.  I will admit to reaching across the table several times to steal potatoes off Charles’s plate. The Smothered Ranchero Burrito was a lot of food. It was stuffed with eggs, beef, black beans, cheese, pico de gallo and sour cream. The entire thing was smothered in red chili sauce. Charles must have been hungry, and this burrito must have been good because Charles quickly devoured every bite.  I am sure we won’t be waiting long before we return to Flo’s again. It is a fun and reasonably priced place for brunch. It is a little out of the way just because there isn’t much happening on that section of Chicago Ave, but it is easily accessible from the 66 bus.  Flo’s is located at 1434 West Chicago Avenue. They do not take reservations.",Kit Graham,27459907,23429573,DINING

D'Amato's Bakery,https://www.zomato.com/chicago/damato-s-bakery-west-town/reviews,"Apr 21, 2019",4,"So a man walks into an Italian bakery in a seemingly run-down neighborhood. Two or three women are fussing over a cookie display while an industrious looking lady hurries in from the kitchen door with freshly baked cannolis and an accent which you thought was meant only for movies. The man looks around and spots a ridiculously shiny, bronzed old style espresso machine. He has his quintessential, big town, old neighborhood, ""Coming to America"" moment. And this is all before he has even ordered anything.   Every major city in the world has a few old style bakeries where even today the prices are unbelievable, the food fresh and the atmosphere pungent with nostalgia. This comes at the cost of the quality of ingredients at times or the menu being a tad out-dated. But these places remain the solid defining threads of a city's culinary fabric. D'amato's a random Google maps' find on a visit to Chicago, is one such gem.  A neat old style Italian bakery, this place offers all sort of cakes, pastries, cookies, pizzas and breads. We went here to pick up a few cookies for tea and coffee and left with stomachs fuller than we thought they could be. I tried the cheese pizza, chocolate and pistachio cannoli and 1-2 cookies. This was about 1-2 hours after a substantial lunch elsewhere. We took home a whole box full of fresh cookies for about 8-10$.  The pizza was warm, extremely cheesy, the size of 400 page novel and very nice. I bought their last chocolate cannoli for the day and found it to be much better than the pistachio one which was basically covered with green dyed peanuts. The filling was fresh and creamy and the pastry very crisp and flaky. The people were friendly and the food as fresh as you could expect. There was a mild lingering taste of slightly inferior fat and the presence of excessive food coloring was obvious in a lot of items on display. Despite this, the sheer deliciousness, freshness and pricing in this day and age in a bustling metropolis like Chicago gets a 4.5/5 from me.",Yash Babar,188202,42663521,DINING

BBQ Pulled Pork - excessive amount of BBQ sauce - it overpowered the pork. It was served on a stale Brioche roll topped with ""un"" crispy onion straws. It came with their Holy Cow chips which are described on the appetizer menu as ""served warm"". These were cold - perhaps leftover. Maybe one had to order them from the appetizer part of the menu to get them warm. The vinegar based slaw was non-descript, however, it was pink. I'm certain this was due to the length of time the red cabbage sat in the dressing - very unappealing.  The server never came to ask 1.) if everything was okay 2.) if I wanted a drink refill. He did show up with the check though so he could receive his tip! Funny how that is.  Will I be back....let's just say...they were ""out"" at first!!",Simran Pande,37960120,33461123,DINING

After having read about the outstanding food at a more accessible location than the average Indian restaurant, we stopped in for an early dinner. There were several parties waiting for the doors to open at 5pm which is a very good sign! The interior is very nice, dim and cool with upbeat clubby Bollywood tunes and white tablecloths covered in white paper. Because it was early and we had plans later that night, we opted out of wine or mixed drinks and I believe this was where we got off on the wrong foot with our waiter. He seemed personally insulted that we refused alcohol and after that he basically wanted nothing to do with us. We saw him smiling and chatting with other tables who were having bottles of wine or several glasses but did not return to our table for 40 minutes until we told the bus boy 3 times that we needed our check. Luckily, all the food is brought out by a second serving person so that didn't interfere with our dining. The flattened rice was incredible and addicting along with the trio of dipping sauces it came with. We started with a nepalese appetizer of goat chhoela which had delicious flavor and sauce but the meat itself was extremely dry and stringy. We then shared the Monsoon Wedding Platter to get a selection of items. The tandoori grill selection was plentiful although not very flavorful. The dal makhani was rich and chili-like with kidney beans as well as lentils. The lamb curry was outstanding with a subtle heat and delicious tender chunks of lamb. I substituted the cumin rice in for the matar pulau because I don't like peas and it was clumpy but good. Naan was nice and crispy too. The rice pudding came out very late and was a strange lukewarm temperature. Possibly it was started late and then tried to be chilled but didn't quite make it?   The serving waiter was very friendly and the bus boy was attentive and quick to remove dishes and pack up our leftovers. I just can't quite get over how the main waiter completely ignored us after taking our order.

I tried the chicken lettuce wraps, soft shell crab roll, unagi trio roll, and spicy tuna roll.  The lettuce wraps were spicy and very messy, just a warning to prepare yourself.  The soft shell crab roll was good, actually lighter than the usual soft shell crab roll so it didn't taste as greasy.  The unagi roll was yummy, but I am a huge fan of eel and the sweet eel sauce.  The spicy tuna roll was a familiar roll, similar to every other sushi place.  But there is nothing wrong with that.    Our service was great, the waiters brought the food out as it was ready very promptly.  So far it was a wonderful experience, the only bad part was the owner/manager(not sure who she was, she alluded to owning the place in her conversation) spent half our meal with her butt in our face.  She apparently knew the couple at the next table well and got into a deep conversation with them about their daughter and her shared love of jumping horses with the couple.

I either could stare at my dinner partner or the kitchen, looking outside wasn't an option because she was standing right next to me, facing the couple, and have her conversation.

Situated not far from a hospital and sizable green space at 1000 North California Avenue, the cozy corner-pocket space originally opened in 2015 still flying beneath many “foodie” radars, it was immediately upon entry that a middle-aged woman offered greetings, a low-slung Pastry case equally welcoming as it tempted with several sweet and savory items.  Owned and operated by Dinah Grossman and Parker Whiteway, the young woman emerging from the kitchen temporarily around 8:00am to put a dish on display and greeting several apparent regulars on the way, it was as light music played overhead that a seven part order was delivered in segments, house Cold Brew refreshing the palate first between bites of a room temperature Cinnamon Roll that was loosely wound and fluffy with light tanginess helping to balance thick Icing on top.  Tightly spaced yet cozy, small booths flanking bar seating and signage requesting guests give up larger spaces to groups if need be, it was next into a crumbly Buttermilk Biscuit that teeth pierced, Honey from a self-service Coffee and Tea station added to taste but still not enough to make it stand out compared to the rest including two Cookies which were both far better than Warm Belly Bakery thanks to a soft center and crispy rim.  Known for Pies long before going brick and mortar, four styles all tempting on this day in addition to a savory Vegetarian Strata, it was in two $5 slices that remaining appetite was invested, the Coffee Sugar Cream textured like Chess with bitterness and sweetness both well represented while Raspberry-Citrus Custard danced atop a buttery crust crowned in faultless Meringue.",Michael U.,24564296,37576070,DINING

PDT : Please don't tell.  Alas, it's hard not to...  Besides the great design and off the beaten path location, the food and beverage is excellent. When a bartender/mixologist comes around the bar, to your table to suggest a different bourbon,  or variation (for the same price ) you know you are getting great service. The Willet Manhattan rocks. I need to try the filet next.  The most important element to all of this is ""the service"". Everyone I have come in contact with at Ada Street has been sincerely friendly and they seem to care. This started at the door, continued with the server, bartender and until the end. Even the chefs in the kitchen look like they are having fun, and you can't miss them.  I thought the idea of passing/offering an amuse bouche tableside ( complimentary or for a small price ) on a slower evening was a nice touch. It's great way to try a bit a something new.  With these new craft cocktail places popping up, it's not usual to get less than stellar service with a ""holier than thou"" attitude. I haven't found that at Ada Street yet, and hope it continues.  I have only three requests: 1. Turn the music/ vinyl down just a tad so we can have a conversation. 2. Continue to hire and train friendly and caring staff. 2.

I hate to say that I cannot recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for an enjoyable dining experience in Chicago. I went here last night with friends and family and was really looking forward to trying something new. While the food was decent and our waitress was nice, we had the most awful experience with the manager (tall, blonde, kind of old) of the restaurant, making me want to avoid this place like the plague. All we tried to do was a use a gift certificate we received for that night for $50 and she told us that we were not allowed to use this on Friday nights. Nowhere on the certificate did it say anything about this stipulation. When I brought this up she started yelling at me and voided herself of all responsibility saying that it was MY PRIVLEDGE that I could use that certificate any of the other days of the week, just not that night. To put the cherry on top, once I had understood that she wasn't going to change anything and went ahead and paid the bill (our waitress apologized to us for her rudeness), she came over to our table to continue the argument in front of the entire party and restaurant! I was completely embarrassed and never had been treated so poorly at a restaurant in my life, especially one where I spent a significant sum. Even after I told her that I was done and began getting up to leave, she continued to speak down to me and degrade me there in the middle of the restaurant. Given I felt terrible for the people at my table and the surrounding ones we just got up and left since we already paid the bill but she completely ruined this restaurant and any type of good feeling that I may have had during this meal.

She heads out on a double date and reviews brunch at Takito Kitchen in Wicker Park. Ah, another Spring weekend in Chicago…I could get used to this. I even made the executive decision to pack up every knit sweater and puffy jacket I own. Let’s hope the weather doesn’t pull a 180 and make me regret it. I kicked off this past Sunday morning with an early barre workout followed by a cherry almond scone (my new favorite flavor) from newly opened, Scone City . Lucky for me, this adorable pastry shop is located right across from my new Wicker Park abode. A few friends of ours were visiting from Nashville, and as a fairly new resident to the Wicker Park area, I was excited to show them the new ‘hood. Post workout and morning pastry, we took a stroll down Division Street. Even on a cloudy day, every single patio we passed was packed to the brim with brunchers. If this weather is here to stay, I’d say patio brunch season may be upon us…finally! We ended up at relatively new, Takito Kitchen. They have a small patio, which was was too crowded to accommodate us, but the inside was relatively unoccupied so we embraced the comfy indoor table. The industrial-chic decor is inviting and very representative of the Wicker Park neighborhood. It felt as if we were destined to dine here! The brunch menu at Takito doesn’t have a very robust list of options, however, most, if not all entrees, sounded delish. The taco plates caught our eyes immediately. Each order comes with 3-4 tacos each, and are perfect for double date sharing. The menu had only a few classic Mexican breakfast options such as Spanish ham & eggs and various flavors of sope. If you’re more of a traditional Bitch who craves waffles and omelettes for brunch, this may not be the place for you. Prior to placing our taco order, we tried a few ‘Bloody Marias’ and mimosas. Both drinks were heavy on the Corazon Blanco…nothin",Bitches Who Brunch,21457303,23643299,DINING
Takito Kitchen,https://www.zomato.com/chicago/takito-kitchen-bucktown/reviews,"Apr 08, 2015",4.5,"Recently, I headed over to Takito Kitchen, a farm to table modern Mexican restaurant with my friend Pam. Takito’s decor is industrial modern, making it a great place to have a casual dinner. It is worth noting that Takito is one of the very few taco places in Chicago (maybe the only?) that will take a reservation. This wins me over since I hate waiting for tacos. I tried the La Paloma cocktail that Pam ordered. It was dangerously good – and had a nice slightly sweet grapefruit taste that hid any trace of alcohol. It came in the cutest terra-cotta cup. I don’t really drink cocktails, but I can make an exception for this one. Has anyone else noticed that grapefruit drinks are having a moment? Takito doesn’t have traditional guacamole, instead they serve an Avocado and Pine Nut Puree with masa crackers. I enjoyed the smooth texture and subtile nutty flavor. The masa crackers are thick sturdy crackers that held up well against the puree. I may try making the Avocado and Pine Nut Puree at home, it would be great on a sandwich. Tacos come three per order, and I had the Chicken Mole Poblano Tacos. The portion size was just right; the tacos were packed with tender shredded meat, peppers, and ricotta. It has a hint of spice but it wasn’t overwhelming. One of my Twitter followers suggested that I try the polenta (pictured at the top of this post), and I am so glad I did. It is a cheesy polenta, with a kick of chili, topped with corn and bacon. Sometimes polenta can be bland, but Takito’s is smooth and creamy, and the toppings add nice texture. Takito Kitchen is located at 2013 West Division Street in Chicago’s Wicker Park. The also have a prix fix Farm to Table Dinner for $28, and they serve a late night menu and brunch.

In the past couple of months Chicago has added two high profile burger joints to the city’s roster of restaurants. Recently Shake Shack has been stealing the spotlight, but Umami Burger (an import from Los Angeles) arrived first. Umami Burger worked its way onto my radar when it started regularly popping up on my instagram feed. Shortly thereafter, a reader emailed me to say that I need to go try the Pumpkin Spice Latte Burger at Umami. When a reader takes the time to send in an email – I know that I need to pay the restaurant a visit. Umami Burger is located on a stretch of Milwaukee Avenue in Wicker Park that has recently been brought to life with several new restaurant openings. A large neon sign identifies the restaurant to passersby. Inside, the space has a large wooden bar to the right, booths along the walls, and freestanding tables in the center of the room. It is a casual, yet welcoming space. It gives off the vibe of a neighborhood hangout where all the locals know each other. I was dining solo that evening so I grabbed a seat at the bar and followed the exact directions I was given, and ordered the Pumpkin Spice Latte Burger. Yes, at first it sounds unusual, but when I read that the burger was topped with mascarpone and tempura kabocha squash, I was sold. A pumpkin spice glaze is drizzled over the top. Upon tasting the burger, you first notice the pumpkin spice flavoring. It isn’t overpowering, but it is there. Then you begin to notice the toppings. The creamy mascarpone and crispy kabocha squash compliment the juicy beef well. The Pumpkin Spice Latte Burger is a seasonal menu item that will be available through the end of the year. While the Pumpkin Spice Latte Burger is a cheeky nod to how obsessed people are with Pumpkin Spice Lattes, it needed to earn its place on the menu by being just as good as the other burgers on the menu. Everything at Umami burger is served a la carte and they offer fries and smushed potatoes that can be paired with the restaurants trio of house-made sauces (jalapeño ranch, garlic aioli, and ketchup). In typical fashion, I ordered more food than I could eat, so I brought home leftovers. This gave me the opportunity to have my unsuspecting husband to blindly taste the Pumpkin Spice Latte Burger. I was curious to see if he would like it, and if he would understand what it was. He didn’t guess that the burger was flavored with pumpkin spice, perhaps because he doesn’t drink the lattes, but he loved the burger – proving that even if the lattes aren’t your thing, the burger might be.

One of my friends was to pick up her boyfriend from Midway and she had to leave by 9:30 PM. We thought we had plenty of time since we sat down at 7:30 PM. Nobody came to order even drinks for a bit. At 8:15 we finally had drinks and had ordered our dinner. At 9:10 PM (yes, we were watching the clock at this point), we finally got part of our order. The waitress then informed us that she forgot to order one of our pasta dishes. At this point, since my friend had to leave, we decided not to wait. Then, there was the check. This process took another 25 minutes. During which time, I went to the ladies room, which was trashed. I'm not sure what happened to Enoteca Roma but clearly there has been a major failure of management. Too bad. Our food, what little we got of it, was good.

But once he was calmed and the rush of the locals started to flow in, we all jumped right in and ordered. Service was really quick. Once we had our paper wrapped, large, very economical, sandwiches in hand, we were forced to taxi back to our office to eat because of a total lack of seating. Literally you have no other option unless you want to sit on the curb out in the front. Two of the loopers ordered the turkey sandwich, which we both enjoyed: fresh bread, good meat, fresh toppings. If we did it again, we'd probably pile on more toppings, but just because we can and there were quite a few italian type toppings to choose from. Another looper got the Caprese on sub roll and thought it was jusk OK. The last looper ordered the non-Italian veggie foccacia and MAN was it impressive. It was huge! Literally probably enough to feed four people and the flavor was simply outstanding. So if you have a little extra time, and you want to try something new, head west and order a sandiwch, order the foccacia, order anything, you cant really go wrong.",Lunch In The Loopers,20866921,16087390,DINING

Not of the hole-in-the-wall variety, but definitely inviting, my appetite and I were rather happy. Scrambled Eggs and Mashedbrown I ordered mashedbrown, eggs scrambled well with Gruyère cheese, and the challah bread French toast. The mashedbrown was a potato cake that I’d buy in bulk and eat in the mornings for a breakfast snack. And since I was able to get Gruyère cheese in my eggs rather than American, jack, or cheddar cheese, I was in love. The French toast was so blooming good that it didn’t require any more syrup than the maple syrup drizzle that came on it. The hazelnut butter and banana creme anglaise gave flavour without making the toast excessively sweet. Challah Bread French Toast So, it seems that Bite Cafe also has lunch and dinner menus.

Another looper sampled the falafel sandwich and loved everything about it. The last looper ordered the grilled portobello sandwich and claimed she had never had anything like it before.

Last night was our third attempt to visit this place as they were closed for the season a while ago and a storm had affected their gelato making abilities last week.  Well worth the wait though.  I believe Black Dog is cash only so plan accordingly.  Once you're inside you'll see they have about a dozen or so flavors but each one is really unique.  Ginger, goat cheese, sweet corn, peach tea, cinnamon, fig blossom and chocolate chip, just to name a few off the top of my head.  I went with the unexpectedly satisfying sweet corn mixed with a classic cookies n creme.  Probably a weird flavor mix but who cares it was great gelato.  You could taste the corn really clearly and if you've ever had a corn cookie from Momofuku Milk Bar in New York you'll know what I'm talking ant and how it makes a really perfect addition to a dessert.   That's not it though.  They had a cooler with pre packed pints of day old ice cream. There was a deal 3 for $10!!

The toffee bits give it a pleasant texture and it all combines for an addictive experience in every spoonful.  My only qualm is the gelato melts unusually fast.

After being invited to check out Chop Shop’s weekend brunch, Charles and I enjoyed a leisurely Sunday brunch, were we might have accidentally ordered more than we could eat. The downstairs has a butcher shop in the middle, tables for dining in the front, a bar area behind the butcher, and then a large event space/concert venue in the back. The second floor, where we were seated, houses additional tables for the restaurant and a second bar. It was calm and quiet and the windows let in plenty of natural light. Charles began his meal with a Bloody Mary, made spicy. He immediately ate all of the garnishes, and praised the spice level of the cocktail. Then we ordered some starters. The menu at Chop Shop is meat-centric to take advantage of the butcher shop downstairs. First we tried prosciutto wrapped burrata with balsamic. The simplicity of the dish let the ingredients shine, and the prosciutto was certainly better than most. This is an appetizer that would be easy to recreate at home. We also tried the Bacon Cheddar Biscuits, which were served with a Bourbon maple butter. The biscuits were buttery, and had crisp chunks of bacon. They were filling, and may have directly contributed to the fact I was only able to finish half of my burger. Then Charles ordered the Banger Stuffed Portabella served with spicy crispy potatoes and a fried egg. The potatoes were slightly fried to a crisp, and seasoned with a bit of chili. This breakfast was big, but Charles managed to down the entire thing. I ordered the burger. It came slathered with melted cheddar, topped with thick cut bacon, and caramelized onions, with thin cut – and addictively delicious fries. The burger itself was cooked perfectly to medium, as I had requested, and was comprised of juicy prime cuts of meat. It was more than I could eat, so I surrendered the extra to Charles who happily helped to eat the burger. Chop Shop also serves lunch and dinner, which I hope to try sometime soon.

Open since 2013, Chop Shop is a multipurpose butcher shop/restaurant/deli/performance space snuggled into a nook on North Ave. directly under the Blue line. The business has some major meat cred behind it, as one of the partners is of the famed Minelli Meat & Deli family. The idea behind Chop Shop is one that appeals to a more modern and younger dining crowd: a pared down and updated steakhouse for those who care about where their meat comes from and who also prefer a more unpretentious, low-key environment. Take away the thick buttery sauces, white linens, and overpriced dishes, and add in a carefully curated beer and cocktail list, an airy, bright space, and a streamlined menu that showcases high quality, affordable meats... voilà, you have Chop Shop! Chop Shop is split into three distinct dining areas. The front portion of the downstairs area (nearest to the entrance) contains the butcher shop/deli cases, in which you can grab a sandwich and park yourself in front of the spacious windows lining North Ave. The rear portion of the downstairs area contains a bar and few booths (the perfect setting for a casual drink & appetizers). Upstairs is where you'll find the main dining room and patio - this is where you should head if you're there for a more traditional restaurant experience.

It was a go to spot for us and most of the other residents of the neighborhood for the entire time we lived there. We even shared some big moments there-- A birthday party for Alex, post-marathon lunches when Alex needed a wings and french fry fix, and even our wedding after party. The Jefferson Tap is everything you want from a neighborhood pub-- good quality bar food, a great beer selection, tons of TV's, drink specials, and a jukebox in a laidback atmosphere. There is nothing fancy about the food here, but what I can tell you is that in the dozens of times we ate here we rarely had a bad meal. Alex and I have tried several items on the menu, but there are a couple that we always order again and again: The Jefferson Tap is also known for their pizza. Interesting, yes, that this neighborhood pub is known for pizza but theirs is really good! I may have indulged in a few slices at our wedding after party. It's a super thing crispy crust and cut Milwaukee ""party-style,"" into small squares. They offer a handful of sizes and toppings, which is perfect for Alex and me since we have very different taste when it comes to what goes on our pizza.

The restaurant is on the small side so get there early and make some friends at the communal tables.

It has the perfect combination of eccentricity and quality in the food. Sometimes the novelty of the food keeps you from fully appreciating just how good it is (it's hard not to be distracted by the fact that you're eating a freaking alligator). Before I stop gushing, I'll just say that that the buffalo brisket jibarito might have been the best sandwich I've ever had; however, it was a special, so don't expect to find it on the menu.  Two things I must admit,  1. The mixed drinks are both terrible and overpriced. Just get a beer. The beer list is top notch.  2.

Charles and I had been talking about trying Big & littles for years, before we finally dined there last week. Big & littles got a little famous when a visit from Guy Fieri landed the River North restaurant on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives. I would say that Big & littles fits into the “diner” category. It does have booth seating, even though it is a big more casual than most diners.  Big & littles has a fast casual concept. You order from the counter up front, and your name is called when the order is ready. The menu at Big & littles is fun – that is just the best way to describe it. There is a little of everything, including fish and chips, burgers, poboys, and tacos. This might be the perfect restaurant for me and Charles – he can be a typical Brit and have fish and chips, meanwhile I can satisfy my constant need for tacos.  Charles loved his gigantic order of fish and chips (pictured above). It was two massive pieces of cod piled over a generous serving of fries. He even said that it was better than most of the fish and chips that he has had back in England. Something tells me Big & littles will become his go-to place for the dish.  I ordered tacos, of course. I had the short rib taco that was a special that day, and the pork taco. It was under $10 total, and the perfect amount of food for dinner (and I might have stolen a few of Charles’s fries). For a fast casual restaurant, Big & littles has some ingredients that are more gourmet. The short rib taco (pictured above) was wonderfully tender and had just enough topping to compliment the beef and make the dish interesting without overwhelming it. The pork taco packed more heat, and was definitely something I would order again.  We both enjoyed our meals at Big & littles, and it made for a very cheap date night. We spent just over $30 on two meals. Had we known that the restaurant is BYOB, we would have brought beer – which would go very well with just about anything on the menu.  Big & littles is tucked away on a quiet corner at 860 North Orleans Street, just a short walk from the Chicago brown line stop. There is a second location in Lakeview on Belmont near the Belmont red/purple/brown line stop.

Being vegan menu studying before venturing is a requirement.

At first I was disappointed they didn't deliver in our area but after going I am so glad they don't; they are too.  First, I would have them deliver three times a day, everyday.  Second, I would miss out on all of the great folks behind the counter.  All of those amazing folks who not only make this awesome deliciousness but who have the best customer service I've experienced in a long time.

You can choose to go by the slice or order a whole pie.  We are big foodies and eaters and can confidently say that for us a 12"" pizza was more than enough plus it provided for left-overs.  The 20"" mega-heifer pizza would feed a small army; one or two slices from that and you're golden.  What goes best with amazing pizza?  Beer.  Do they have it?  You betcha!

We stumbled upon Lucia for a girls night when searching for a restaurant that could sit 8 people, was BYOB, and in the WP neighborhood. Enter Lucia! They were able to accommodate our group with only a 30 minute's notice. The place is so dang charming. It feels like you're in an old world Italian house. The food prices are extremely reasonable, portions large (you'll have leftovers), and... did I say BYOB?

Minestrone soup - I feel bad for the next person who ordered it - I got all the cabbage! Minus the cabbage, there was 2 peas, 3 pieces of carrots, 1 kidney bean, 1piece of celery, 2 chickpeas, a couple of little tubular pastas. The broth was good.  BBQ Pulled Pork - excessive amount of BBQ sauce - it overpowered the pork. It was served on a stale Brioche roll topped with ""un"" crispy onion straws. It came with their Holy Cow chips which are described on the appetizer menu as ""served warm"". These were cold - perhaps leftover. Maybe one had to order them from the appetizer part of the menu to get them warm. The vinegar based slaw was non-descript, however, it was pink. I'm certain this was due to the length of time the red cabbage sat in the dressing - very unappealing.  The server never came to ask 1.) if everything was okay 2.) if I wanted a drink refill. He did show up with the check though so he could receive his tip! Funny how that is.  Will I be back....let's just say...they were ""out"" at first!!",Simran Pande,37960120,33461123,DINING

But rather my experience upon stepping foot in restuaraunt. I was in Chicago a two weeks ago. This was just after Puerto Rican parade and i realize it may have been a frustrating and overwhelming time, however, none of that is an excuse for what we experienced. I WAS THERE TO MEET FAMILY I NEVER KNEW I HAD..a niece n nephew. They grew up Mexican and had never been exposed to their Puerto Rican side. We meet and i took them to eat at Nelly's and after stopped at La Plena to see if I could pickup some rellenos and alcapurrias for them to take home to their Pilsen neighborhood. We walked in and i asked for what I was looking for, as I did one of the kids went to the bathroom. I was told by owner that they only sold plates. I THANKED HIM AND TOLD HIM I WAS JUST LOOKING FOR FRITURAS. We walked outside and waited for the person in bathroom. The owner followed us outside. He made us feel uncomfortable and told us we could NOT loiter outside. I told him we were waiting for person in bathroom. He pointed to a sign on window that stated that bathrooms were for patrons. I told him we intended to buy something but he didn't offer what we needed. He got quite irrational and said,  "" All you Puerto Ricans are the same"". I kept telling him he was overreacting and that we didn't come in with some covert agenda to use his bathroom. He was violent in his language and kept getting closer n closer invading my personal space. At one point i told him that my niece n nephew were being exposed to the Puerto Rican culture for the first time and he was the first impression  they were getting. He kept on n on about the bathroom, so i went into my purse n gave him $5. HE YELLED AT ME saying money didn't change the fact that we Puert Ricans are disgusting people  who have no respect. I went inside n left the $5 in the table. He told me he didn't need my effing money n continued trashing Puerto Ricans. My family n I started walking away n he continued yelling about the bathroom and using derogatory language about Puerto Ricans. I yelled back to him saying that i paid for the use of his bathroom. He told me he didn't need my money to which i responded"" but you kept the money. He called me a stupid bitch and a whore and then went into the store where i left the money. He came out and continued cursing me, took the money and threw it on the street and called me a few mire vile words and told me to take my money and shove it up my ass.  This place is owned by someone who obviously has no self respect and obviously has no pride in his very own culture. Either that or he was high or drunk.

I hate to say that I cannot recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for an enjoyable dining experience in Chicago. I went here last night with friends and family and was really looking forward to trying something new. While the food was decent and our waitress was nice, we had the most awful experience with the manager (tall, blonde, kind of old) of the restaurant, making me want to avoid this place like the plague. All we tried to do was a use a gift certificate we received for that night for $50 and she told us that we were not allowed to use this on Friday nights. Nowhere on the certificate did it say anything about this stipulation. When I brought this up she started yelling at me and voided herself of all responsibility saying that it was MY PRIVLEDGE that I could use that certificate any of the other days of the week, just not that night. To put the cherry on top, once I had understood that she wasn't going to change anything and went ahead and paid the bill (our waitress apologized to us for her rudeness), she came over to our table to continue the argument in front of the entire party and restaurant! I was completely embarrassed and never had been treated so poorly at a restaurant in my life, especially one where I spent a significant sum. Even after I told her that I was done and began getting up to leave, she continued to speak down to me and degrade me there in the middle of the restaurant. Given I felt terrible for the people at my table and the surrounding ones we just got up and left since we already paid the bill but she completely ruined this restaurant and any type of good feeling that I may have had during this meal. Never was anything offered to remedy the situation. I'm still a little in shock from this despicable service experience.

I felt like it was a little better than Sushi Para II with respect to the restaurant setup and time of food turnaround. Sushi can get pricey, and I understand the draw of a place giving you all you can eat for $18.99. None the less, you pay an additional ""cost"" in service, care of preparation, and quantity of rice. I'm giving them 2.5 out of 5 Pearls.",Jeff,21400427,9609343,DINING

We were excited to see that we had a Thai place just a couple blocks from where we live... until we ate there. Bad decor, bad service and bland food. How do you make Thai food bland?!? We thought maybe we visited on a bad day. Maybe we'd appreciate take out -- without the bad decor and service? The second time was no different. We both agree that you can get better Thai food out of a box from the grocer. So, for now, our Thai cravings require that we go further afield.",Colorado Rob,23745530,16114549,DINING

Probaly the best thing was the hamchi that they didn't have to do anything too.

Tozi,https://www.zomato.com/chicago/tozi-korean-bbq-restaurant-bucktown/reviews,"Feb 05, 2017",4,"Sometimes a few places happily surprise you, Tozi is one such place. On a Saturday night as I was looking through UberEATS, I came across Tozi and suggested it to my friend as an option for home delivery. Instead he said we should just head there for dinner, and I am glad we did.   We reached the place at around 9 in the night. Christmas tree at the entrance indicated that they were still in holiday hangover. The place was pretty much empty except for a few tables that were occupied. The decor is basic yet intimate. We sat in a booth and started browsing the menu. Our server for the evening was Sky and on his suggestion I ordered Sikhye, a non alcohol drink made out of rice. I was very apprehensive about this and thought it would be heavy. But, Sikhye turned out to be so wonderfully refreshing and light that my friend ordered one for himself too! For food we ordered: Vegetable Dumplings (I had been craving for decent dumplings for a while now, these were delicious!) Vegetable Barbecue (We loved this. We were given an array of sauces to pick from to go with our grilled veggies. The end result was really good. Although their menu has a strict rule about two orders of barbecue per table, as we were just two people they didn't mind.) Sizzling Stone Bowl (Popularly known as Bibimbap, is a bowl of warm white rice served with veggies. This was mixed with chilli sauce and served. Tasted nice.)  The staff was very friendly and helpful. They gave us helpful tips and suggestions and were very thoughtful that we are vegetarians. Food is great and well priced. Such places make trying a new cuisine more exciting! Will head back to try more. I definitely recommend!",Akshatha,379024,29404932,DINING
