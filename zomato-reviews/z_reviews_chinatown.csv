The staff seemed friendly and had good recommendations for us. We tried the egg tools and the chicken in stick which were delicious. Their lamb on stick looked really good but didn't meet my expectations. However I liked their chicken fried rice much, but I would recommend anyone to mention it to be made spicy if they preferred. I also took their child milk tea with Tapioca which went well after the nice dinner. Overall it was a good start for my first Chinatown visit here in Chicago!",Sirisha,12565291,43288866,DINING

What I love about this place is their small portion of food that helps me taste diverse variety of food.  I had been here with my friend about 2 months ago and now writing the reviews.  We ordered for pan fried vegetable roll, egg yolk paste bun , veg noodles and egg yolk tart ( that's what I think it was called...pic with yellow inside a tart)  I loved each and every thing I ordered here. And so much value for money. My best was the egg yolk tart though I do not know the name of dish. Soo crisp , just melts in your mouth and perfect sweet taste.  Apart from the tasty food you get here, the staff are extremely courteous and helpful.  Must visit and highly recommended!!! Yummmm food and good value for money.

Lao Sze Chuan had a long wait so we decided to go here - big mistake, we should have waited. The only good thing from the many plates we ordered was the complimentary cookie they served us at the end. We ordered, egg drop soup (tasted bland, lacked salt or any other form of seasoning), pork dumplings (batter was too heavy, dumplings was very greasy, and pork was questionably pork), unfried sesame chicken (gooey SWEET mystery chicken, not savory at all, sauce was like candy - very off putting), beef vegetable rice noodle dish (overly sauced but somehow way under seasoned and bland, noodles were over cooked and mushy, and meat was again very questionable and off putting). Staff was clueless and didn't speak English (Understand this is a restaurant in Chinatown, but i expect the staff to be able to minimally communicate with their customers). We usually bring home our left overs but here, everything was so bad, we couldn't bare to eat it a second a time. We will not back and I regret spending money here.

They also offers various congees - standard pork and century egg to chicken and abalone.  They're also fantastic for dinner with various fancy elevated Chinese seafood dish.

After minutes of bickering I explain that I will pay for the other food that I really enjoyed, but I refuse to pay for food that was not cooked and it's not what I orders.

Pros:  -chicken had a good batter and was somewhat crispy -decent amount of peppers mixed in including sliced jalapenos -sauce was decently spicy, but not hot Cons: -I felt like the chicken could have been crispier -I also felt like the sauce was just slightly over-sweetened. (Previous two cons are just personal opinions on how I feel General's Chicken should taste. ) -My box takeout did not include white rice  On a General's Chicken rating, this is about an 8.5-9. Around Detroit, it's really hard to get good General's chicken due to all the restaurants either trying to go 'nuasian' and using white meat chicken with no batter, or due to the restaurant just being sub-par.  Other notes on the restaurant: It seems their ""casserole"" dishes are actually just dishes that are served in a decorative steel bowl placed over a sterno fuel at your table and made to stay hot/continue cooking there. Your fuel may cause your dish to begin boiling (though since they use solid fuel, don't be afraid to blow it out). The dim sum is pretty great here as well - though what do you expect, you're in Chinatown.  Overall, an 8.5 to me; great restaurant with family sized meal portions at decent prices.

I tried the spicy shrimp and scallops, which came surrounded by a ring of Chinese bok choy. It brought a smile to my face, as did the shrimp toast appetizer. Service was friendly and prompt, and my menu questions were answered without too much lost in translation.  The large dining room is attractive, if dated in appearance. Being on the second floor, you can dine overlooking the large Chinese Gate that predominates the traditional entrance to Chinatown, which adds a festive touch to your dining experience. (The casino buses drop off their riders outside the door...what else could be more Chinese?) I am certain there are better, more fashionable Chinese restaurants in Chicagoland.

This is a friendly, attractive 'old style' restaurant but they know how to get the food out quickly for folks needing to get to their next flight. The range of menu offerings covers appetizers, salads, sides, sandwiches and recognizable entrees as well as a very good selection of beer, cocktails and other adult beverages. The bar looked like it would be lots of fun to find a place and settle in for a while. Good food, good service and acceptable prices for an airport.....this is a good option if you have a bit of time between flights.

Phoenix Restaurant,https://www.zomato.com/chicago/phoenix-chinatown/reviews,"Mar 09, 2016",4,"My first review for a restaurant that we've been to many, many times. This is our number one choice when it comes to Dim Sum and the benchmark to which we compare other dim sum restaurants to. Today was the first time in a while since we've eaten here, and things have changed a little. Over the past couple years, they've been altering/remodeling the dining area, and it looks amazing. Those looking to host a small wedding reception should certainly keep this place in mind. In terms of changes, this restaurant used to have servers push carts around the dining area with stacks of dim sum or other foods. You would always hope that the right cart was working their way to your table, and that they still had food left (because every other table between you and the kitchen has been grabbing dishes off the cart). This has now been replaced with a more efficient and complete menu, allowing you to choose whatever you want and as much as you want. Pricing is a la carte of course. The food is still good and the service is unchanged. No Chinese restaurant has great service in my opinion. You go for the food. You want service, go somewhere else.

Owned by Joyce Chiu and brother Matthew, their no-frills approach to Pastries, Cakes, Buns and more having additionally entered Uptown with further expansion planned, it is from 7:00am until 8:00pm daily that guests are welcomed – COVID-19 currently seeing extra safety measures implemented at a space that already appears quite clean.  Cash only then and now, with dining area currently closed but take-out sales faring well thanks to Chiu Quon’s recent partnership with Facebook advertising, it is from over 100 daily items that diners must make choices, many of them familiar to those familiar with Chinese Cuisine but others previously unseen.  Purporting to use “the finest Ingredients,” a dubious statement considering the low price point, it was at a cost of just under $17 that ten choices were bagged, a lack of seating finding the Taro Bun enjoyed on nearby church steps while Black Sesame baked similarly had an unpleasant gelatinous center as though it was undercooked.  Next sampling a refrigerated Walnut Bean Paste Cake, the Pastry on this as well as a “mini” Moon Cake buttery around well-textured Filling, suffice it to say that arriving immediately after Egg Custard Tarts emerged from the oven was fortuitous – both Hong Kong and Portuguese styles still jiggly with *better* largely a matter of personal taste.  Taking a chance or two before finishing familiar, Chiu Quon’s Sesame Pork Cookie undoubtedly an acquired taste, it seems hard to believe anyone might enjoy a “Peanut Rice Cake” that eats like sawdust in a flavorless Hostess Snoball, a far better taste and value offered by textbook Sesame Balls or golden Dough baked around subtly sweet Lotus Paste.",Michael U.,24564296,50116514,DINING

Go 4 Food,https://www.zomato.com/chicago/go-4-food-chinatown/reviews,"Apr 30, 2015",4,"Sometimes you just gotta go for the exotic. When jet setting around the world isn’t an option, where do you go to satisfy your craving for adventure? I tend to seek out ethnic Chicago neighborhoods and obscure eateries where no one speaks English. Lucky for me, my fair city offers plenty of choices. When I got that itch recently, my gal pal and I headed to Chicago’s Chinatown.  I have been to Chinatown on many occasions, exploring shops and sipping bubble tea after consuming noodles or dim sum or hot pot. Every time I am there I think there will be no surprises. Every time I am wrong. Be it the Great Frog Massacre at the butcher counter in the supermarket (yes, frogs lost their heads right before my very eyes) or the gorgeous liquor store that stocks Chinese Bordeaux-style wine, I am never bored in Chinatown. The destination of my recent trip was Go4Food USA, a tiny storefront off the beaten path that calls itself “Chinese restaurant in Chinatown”.  Located on an obscure block of tiny side street, away from Zodiac Square and the main drags of the neighborhood, Go4Food would be easy to miss. DON’T MISS IT. Take my word for it, this place is worth seeking out. From Hundred-Spice Chicken to French-Style Beef Tenderloin to Spicy Tofu to Szechuan Eggplant, the menu here is vast and has lots of options for everyone. But make no mistake: seafood is the name of the game here. After you grab a seat at one of six tables, your eyes will be inundated with mouth-watering images of shellfish dishes on the walls. Posters beckon you with lobster and oysters. TV screens at eye level flash images of crabs and seafood medleys. Anchoring the dining room is a large aquarium where crustaceans await their turn on your plate.  Ask questions. The staff here is very enthusiastic, and at least one of them spoke very good English. It was at his guidance that we selected our menu: the famous French-Style Beef (excellent!), some on-choy in brown sauce (a seasonal vegetable, very earthy and delicious!), and three glorious options of shellfish. To start, a GIANT platter of razor clams on the bed of cellophane noodles in flavorful broth arrived, and I kid you not, I have never seen a dish this size be called an appetizer. Large slender razor clams were steamed open and topped with fresh scallions, cilantro and bean sprouts. We slurped them, mopping up the broth with noodles. Next came Shrimp in Salted Egg Yolk, truly a revelation. Plump pink shrimp were lightly coated in feather-light batter and gently stir-fried. They were soft and yielding, with a very subtle satisfying crunch on the outside. What made the dish truly special though was the paste of salt and duck egg yolk that coated the shrimp. Rich and unctuous and very eggy, this condiment the color of sunshine was nothing short of spectacular.  But the star of our show was Fusion Chili Crab: a whole dungeness crab hacked up into pieces and cooked in finger-licking combo of chilies, Chinese five-spice, ginger, garlic, scallions and as far as I am concerned–pure magic. The aroma was intoxicating. These crabs were special indeed. While not traditional (Fusion Chili Crab is a proprietary recipe of Go4Food), it was so unbelievably delicious, I could definitely forego the tradition. There is no graceful or lady-like way to eat this dish. You gotta roll up your sleeves and just dive in. Silence fell over our table, interrupted only by the sounds of enthusiastic crunching of the shell. At one point as I looked up from my plate, I saw my very old-school, proper Southern Belle dining companion reach over to the bowl (now empty of crab),scoop the savory fragrant mess of the thick sauce in a pinch with her fingers and pop it in her mouth. We have been eating together for a long time. This woman eats her pizza and hamburgers with knife and fork. FINGERS IN THE BOWL OF PURE BLISS. Yet another surprise brought forth by Chinatown.  As we walked down sun drenched sidewalks of Chinatown, we made a list of all the dishes that we need to come back to try: Dungeness Crabs in Housemade XO Sauce, Seafood Medley in Egg Whites, Lobster, Hundred-Spice Chicken, Clams, Oysters, Fried Silver Fish, Braised Pigeon, Pork Belly… Our list went on and on. So, it looks like I will be returning to Go4Food in the near future.

Vegetarians are left waiting until the meat eaters have finished their meals before getting their dishes, even when the server is alerted to the issue; the food is often cold and the sauces, rather than silky, are gelatinous. Most often, the moo shoo pancakes are stuck to each other and inseparable. The duck is a waste of money as most of it remains uncarved and taken back to the kitchen as trash. Delivery is a problem and the restaurant staff lie constantly about where your order is. They oftentimes get the order wrong and then charge you anyway.

My family is from Sichuan and I was very enthusiastic in trying your restaurant Lao Sze Chuan.   Unfortunately, my experience was extremely disappointing. The food was laced with MSG, and the spices were unbearable even from a fellow Sichuaner's standards. After the night, my family and I suffered from hemorrhoids due to the extreme levels of red pepper used in the food and the MSG, and was almost needing of medical treatment. For the sake of your restaurant, do not sacrifice quality for quantity - use natural flavorings, not MSG. And please ask your waiter/waitresses to advise customers on how spicy the food is.   Thank you.",Jack Z.,23253584,16102036,DINING

Listen, it's a cramped, box-shaped restaurant in a corner of a strip mall. The ambiance is not there but the service is fast, albeit curt, but who cares with food this wonderful? It starts off with them bringing chile-oil infused cabbage shreds. A spicy, crunchy, fresh salad starter. Then I order the potstickers (ok, i know it's very typical of an outsider to order these appetizers b/c it's not off the beaten path but these suckers are filled to the brim and toasted so well - best in the city) and they are accompanied by 2 sauces - a hoisin and a chili-oil. Watch out for that chili oil- it's a scorcher and the most fun to dare others with! The mongolian beef (another usual, almost-lame Chinese dish, I'm aware) is tender and meaty and order it spxiy if you dare.

My old college roommate, Ivan and I always opt to come here to get together for a visit. This has going on since we were students to now him having two children. Ken Kee is located in the new Chinatown of Chicago or Archer Square. It's tiny and at times the wait can be long. However, I got seated right away for lunch since I got there first.  We ordered the usual favorites like salt and pepper smelts, Japanese egg tofu with king mushroom, as well as beef fried rice. We also ordered shrimp wontons for his small boy and the broccoli and garlic as the token vegetable. I kinda wanted to order more stuff like fish and the Hainanese chicken but I followed their suit. I was so surprised when the food came, the portion was puny. Then, my friend told me that it had been a well known issue that they reduced their portion size and kept the same price as a measure to be profitable without raising the price. He said he had witnessed a fight between the restaurant and a customer who got upset over the portion size. He also said he hasn't been coming here in awhile because of it as well.  I agree.. The portion was way smaller. That made this place quite pricy for a Chinese Chinatown joint. The taste was still great though. I still really enjoyed the food a lot but there wasn't enough to go around. Lol.  We also ordered some tapioca pearl drinks: red and green bean drinks, Mango smoothie, and my fave watermelon freeze with tapioca and lychee. All were fantastic as always.  It would be too hard to break a habit of coming here after all these years. Next time I know that we need to order more food. Since the taste and service were still as I remember it, I forgave them for getting new smaller serving platters. Usually when a restaurant does this, they tried to be subtle.

However, this time we were back to Cai since one of my friends had $100 credit there he needed to use up. We said.. Well, ok!  It was surprisingly a nice change from Ming Hin. We had a big table and I made the mistake to sit at the way inside at the opposite direction of where the server delivered the food on the huge lazy Susan. By the time it got to me, most of the foods have been ravaged and I couldn't take good picture.   The dim sum ain't bad. All the standard dumplings and dim sum offerings were decent. We also ordered or given stuff we didn't order by mistake, but we took it and paid for it but we accidentally ate some good stuff. Accidentally we got this breaded fried squid in spicy sauce that turned out to be my fave though it was off a regular menu, not dim sum. I was able to take picture of that. There was also this dumpling wonton soup with only one gigantic wonton in the bowl. That was super tasty too! Oh, lastly, this tofu dish that was so delicious. Diced crispy tofu with eggy velvety inside cooked with red peppers and chives. Yum.  The negative compared to the other establishments, Cai didn't have any private room.

[Originally written August 13, 2006] Saint's Alp Teahouse is best known as a bubble tea place. But it is much bigger than just that, essentially it is a afternoon/evening hangout where people (especially young) can go and just hang out over light food and bubble tea and smoothies. Much in the line of Destiny in Scarborough (Toronto, ONT) or Freshman's in Beaverton (Portland, OR). A place you would go to at night, with music with a beat in the background, and hang out with friends, maybe play games. Right now, the Chicago store is about 40 days old (I asked), so they will see how the place evolves and what the feel of the place turns into.  Their drinks selection is much wider than most places. Saint's Alp is a Hong Kong based chain, and there are many more categories then a couple types of bubble tea and a couple types of smoothies. I had a choco mint, which was a cross between a shake and bubble tea with flakes of chocolate inside. A nice cool diversion on a hot summer day (or night).",Louis,20888848,16111018,DINING
