The only downside is the ordering and being seated. When we came in we pre-ordered food on one side of the counter. Then put our names on a wait list. After waiting about 35 minutes we were seated. I would have guessed that within that amount of time the pizza we ordered would be just about ready and we could eat almost right away. Wrong we waited another 30+ minutes before the pizza was brought out. Again, it was incredibly tasty but I would be sure to get to the restaurant before my stomach starts to growl next time. "

But you might not enjoy the thick crust. I found myself more into thin crust ones. 2. Dry-rubbed wings are too salty and my mouth burns after the meal.

If you're in a hurry (like we we're) go for the express menu offer. Its about $7 and offers a small personal pizza (easily enough for one) and small side. The larger pizzas are still pretty good value and the amount of cheese pull we witness was extraordinary. Michigan av location is pretty large so good for groups. Was relatively quite when we were in at 1:30 midweek.

Giordano’s was only 2 blocks away so perfect... so we thought. First bite & it was cold! Also found sausage that was pink. Waiter sent manager over who didn’t apologize, just asked what we would like to do. Giving benefit of the doubt we sent pizza back to get fully cooked. Not even 10 minutes later pizza came back & 1st bite of new “recooked”pizza had sausage so raw you could undeniably see the red of the uncooked meat. Our waiter was shocked & embarrassed & again sent manager over. I showed to the manager, he said OMG, & literally took our pizza away... again no apology, no I’ll get you a new pizza, nothing!! Our poor waiter had to come over & tell us they were taking the pizza off our bill. Whoever runs Giordano’s needs to do some serious customer service classes because that manager didn’t seem to care that we were there or that we got uncooked pizza. Even when we walked in the door he was complaining to another employee about a co-worker (also pretty sad that I could hear the whole conversation as we waited for our table). I’m giving this review 1 star because I have to but we will never return for your pizza."

You should try it! We order the small Chicago style pizza (for two persons) and it was more than enough. We ate 60% of the pizza, the rest came home with us. For sure a great place to eat some amazing pizza!"

Their pizzas are hard to beat. The deep dish pizzas are amazing! You also need to try the thin version. Those are good too. They have their system down like a well oiled machine. It does take at least an hour for a deep dish so you will not be in and out. It is worth it.

I have had Giordano's before and thought the food was better previous times I have eaten there. It could be the location this was my first time at this location, or that we went at lunch, but was really excited to have a pizza and came away disappointed. The service could also be a big part of the reason I was disappointed in the food. Our waitress literally disappeared for 45 minutes. We had to have other waiters get us refills on our drinks and get our bill. We looked around for her and she was nowhere to be found."

But again, it’s ok","Long wait to get in on a Saturday afternoon. By the time we left about 230 no wait at all. Coming here from out of the area, of course we ordered the deep dish. Veggie special specifically. Undercooked. Crust was extremely soggy, to the point the serving dish was leaking water on to the table. It tasted fine, but a bit of a disappointment. Wait staff was fine. We didn’t complain but likely will not return."

We did this anticipating a 45 minute wait for our pizza. When we got there we only had to wait 10 minutes to be seated but they did advise us to go ahead and order our pizza. We ordered the quintessential deep dish. Service was just okay. We ordered waters to drink which contained very little ice so we did have to request a glass of ice. We discovered little to no ice is a Northern issue. The pizza came out in a timely manner and it was everything we were hoping for. Not at all disappointed. Will be back on our next trip.

Service nice reasonably affable considering how busy these folks are. Kept thinking John Belushi was going to show up --- ""Cheeseburger,cheeseburger,pepsi,pepsi. They have an odd way of doing this . you place your order at a counter and they begin the baking process and you sort of hang around where ever you can find a seat. i offered my seat to a lady. Evidently that is rare as i watched fat boy chicago boys phone fiddling while 60+ yo ladies stood. But there is some people watching opportunities Now onto the pizza-- worth the wait ?? you bet. Good salad, really,really good pizza. what a delight. Boy oh boy is this stuff good. reasonably priced.

Tips on optimizing wait time.,"If you are visiting Chicago, this is definitely the place to try the famous Chicago Style Deep Dish Pizza.We were there with a party of 8. Estimated wait time during lunch was 60 minutes! We could not wait that long. Bummer is that they don't take reservations. However we learned that at the inside reception area they have two lines one for ""Wait List"" and other is for ""Pre Order"". We decided to come back for dinner and optimize our wait time.We arrived early by 6:00 PM and the estimated wait time was 90 minutes! We stood in line for ""Wait List"" and put our name down. We were told we will get a text in 75 to 90 minutes and we must respond to the text in 5 minutes to hold our spot.Then we stood in the ""Pre-Order"" line and placed order for a Cheese Pizza and Veggie Pizza. We were told the Pizza prep time is 90 minutes.Now we had 90 minutes to walk around and enjoy the Michigan Ave.When we got seated around 7:30, out Pizza was ready. It arrived in 5 minutes.

Our server was slow - having been in the food service industry and worked in every possible job at a restaurant, I can say she had zero sense of urgency in providing customer service to us or any of her other tables, though she was helpful in giving us an approximate wait time on our food.

I had not had deep-dish pizza before, and it was amazing! The crust is just deliciousness in warm bread form, and the ingredients were fresh and wonderful. We also got peach sangria, which is made in house instead of shipped in like the red sangria is, and it was refreshing and perfectly balanced. The service was incredible. I was made to feel like an old regular customer walking in rather than a first-tuner, and our server guided us to the correct portion sizes (thank goodness we didn’t get a medium pie, we didn’t even finish the small!) our server told us to take the leftovers and give them to a Chicagoan who would appreciate some good food.

It takes 40 minutes to make the pizza (all are individually made to order) so we ordered a Giordano’s Sampler as a starter whilst we waited, accompanied by Blue Moon and Sam Adams beer, all of which were very good.The pizzas are huge; one of us had a small (one person) pizza with artichokes, mushrooms and black olives and could not finish it whilst two of us shared a small Chicago Classic, of which we only managed to eat two thirds. The Classic comprised cheese, tomato and pepperoni with red peppers and onion. It was excellent and looked like a quiche with the deep crust and filling.Service was really attentive. Recommended."

I’m a NJ/NY guy who grew up on good Italian pizza- i.e. the “thin crust “ type baked in a brick oven preferably, so I had to see what all the fuss was about for Chicago “thick crust” pizza. My colleague and I split the smallest “Personal Pizza” with a few added toppings. Wow! The diameter may be small but at 2 1/2 inches thick this tiny pizza was a full meal for two hungry guys. Great taste, fresh ingredients and very different than NY style pizza. I must say service was a bit slow but friendly and apologetic. We apparently hit a late lunch rush. Plenty of choices on this comfort food menu. Check it out. "

Cheese. The quality and quantity of hot oozing cheese makes this beat out Lou M’s in my book. The cheese holds the toppings down and is soft and light, just an amazing concept. The crust is a little much as I prefer a thin buttery crust. Also, when cold it’s like eating a brick of cold cheese so cold leftovers are to be avoided. You have to try this if you’re in Chicago."

The crust in the deep pan is actually very thin but very dry underneath whilst also undercooked, must be a special technique!

I was very disappointed. The restaurant is very plain - nothing exceptional. The pizza, which was the real reason we came, was not good. We ordered a 1/2 and 1/2 pizza with one half being a specialty of the restaurant that included green peppers and onions; and the other half was ground beef, onions, black olives and mushrooms. I got a pizza that was stuffed almost entirely with green peppers and onions. I had to search to find the beef and mushrooms and the black olives were sprinkled on top (yuck). The crust had no special flavor and the sauce was mediocre, at best. Literally, there is a place in my hometown that does Chicago-style pizza and they have this place beat all day long. I didn't care for the inch of sauce on top of the pizza, either. Dough was moist and wet - didn't seem cooked all the way through. Sorry to all the other ""lovers"" of this place, but I won't be going back."

My expectations were exceeded. The Italian Beef deep dish pizza was the perfect marriage of what I read were two Chicago classics. Though it was spicy, it was the perfect amount of heat to keep things interesting and yet still edible. It was unique, and an experience I would recommend for those who can take a bit of spice. The individual pizza size was a large portion, and definitely a good value for money.For those who can't handle heat though, the deep dish pizza we ordered with pepperoni and mushroom was divine as well. 10/10, would recommend, would eat again. Additionally, my Italian Beef pizza came with a salad (the house salad), which was just big enough for two to share as an appetizer. It was delicious, and just like the Italian beef, had enough character to be an experience but not so much that it felt weird. Our waiter was very nice, very attentive, and professional. All in all, a great time for people who want to try ""Chicago Fare."""

Some let the delivery people come to the room, others not. This one I needed to meet them downstairs when they called. Delivery was pretty much on time for what was estimated. There was many other delivery people there as well, and the drivers do not have much saying where they were from, so it was a bit awkward wandering around the lobby asking each stranger who they were with.What is there to be said about the food, other than it was much heavier than I thought it would be.

We ordered some Salad and a small deep dish pizza with chicken sausage and spinach. We were four in the group and could barely finish the small pizza. The wait was OK since we were watching the game and drinking beer. Pizza came nice and hot. Can't hold and eat this pizza, definitely a knife and fork affair. Taste was great.

I ordered sangria, which is a very common drink, although it was good, it was 90% ice and 10% drink. As someone who bartended for seven years, I would never serve this to a customer. I said something, so our server brought a new one, which was much better.The interior and patio on the sidewalk of this place was nice, the people at the front door were friendly as well as other staff members that I encountered.

It was very busy and they got us in and out according to our time table.Maybe it's because we couldn't stay the 45 (WHAT????) minutes it says on the menu it takes to cook one of their specialties so we opted for the express lunch of a BEAUTIFUL FRESH salad and a personal deep dish pizza. The pizza was NOT what I was expecting...it had a grossly undercooked base to it so it tasted like I was eating a bowl of uncooked dough. The sauce was really good though. Did I miss the experience by not getting the real thing? Perhaps. ADVICE: leave plenty of time to grab the big one and I bet you'll like the experience better. This was the Giordano's at Navy Pier

They have tables out front on the sidewalk and we had planned to sit there but as it turned out, it was a little chilly so we decided to sit inside. We ordered the sampler appetizer along with some brews to enjoy while our pie cooked. The sampler platter was pretty decent. Be careful that you don't order too much of a pie if you go the deep dish route. A small will easily feed two reasonable people. The pizza came to our table right at 30 mins.

I have never seen pizza like this in the NorthEast nor even in Italy and don't have any interest to see it again. Waited almost 2 hours to have the pizza put in front of us. At that point was starving. Don't see the point of putting in the order when you arrive since you don't get it for 2 hours anyway. Drinks had hardly any ice in them and the lemonade was clearly powdered crap. Just what you want on a 90 degree day, yum- warm powdered lemonade.

From the time seated, another HOUR before we got our pizza. it was delicious and small for us, was still alot for 2 people. The server was very friendly and we did not have to wait long to get our bill, pay up and be on our way. Upon departure, once again, many people waiting for a seat.

I had the chopped salad which was great although it says the dressing is honey mustard, it didn't taste like it. It was good whatever it was and the salad helped with the 45 minute wait it takes to cook a deep dish. You just have to deal with the wait because it can't be helped and it is worth it!Beer selection is very good with beers from all over the US including my home state of Louisiana.

The restaurants had declined in quality and service, and with so much to choose from . . .We decided to give the new location in our neighborhood a try over the weekend. The owners did a spectacular job building this new restaurant in an older historic building on South Michigan Avenue. Sadly, they've apparently forgotten the food.Who ever heard of an Italian restaurant running out of meatballs? Well that's what they told us when we tried to order, and this caused two in my party to quickly scramble to find something else. Instead of the four-cheese ravioli, I picked the veal parmigiana. This turned out to be a mistake. The veal was pedestrian, and it was plopped on a bowl of lukewarm spaghetti. No ""real"" parmesan cheese was available and I was stuck with grocery store ground cheese.Others in the party were equally dissatisfied with their meals. The sauce had all the makings of quality dishes, but they failed to deliver. Asked for a manager when we were leaving but were told none was available. Meh."

On our visits to the South Loop or Frankfort or Homewood or Palos Heights locations, we love to sample the Italian beef sandwich or mostaccioli or beef ravioli (my wife's favorite) or meatball sandwich. And how about the deep dish cookie dessert? It's a half-pound chocolate chip cookie baked in a deep dish pizza pan and smothered with vanilla ice cream. Love the calories."

But, truth be told, I never sampled any of Aurelio's fare until they opened a franchise in the South Loop at 1212 South Michigan Avenue. Today, it's hard not to find an Aurelio's anywhere in the Chicago area, from Arlington Heights to La Porte, Indiana. Joe Aurelio started in austere fashion, only four tables, a small kitchen and one pizza oven. He sold only six or seven pizzas and a few Italian beef sandwiches per day. But business was good and in 1974 he began to franchise, expanding to Joliet. More expansion continued in the 1980s and 1990s. Today, there are 41 locations in Illinois, Indiana, Florida, Georgia, Nevada and Minnesota. The flagship location, at 18162 Harwood Avenue in Homewood, in a converted warehouse that was built in 1927, is the world's largest pizzeria with 16,000 square feet of space. The menu is expansive and overwhelming and fulfilling. What'll you have? Chicken tenders or garlic bread or onion rings or toasted ravioli or hot wings or chili for an appetizer. Sandwiches? Meatball or ham or chicken or Italian beef or Italian sub or Italian combo. Pasta? Spaghetti or mostaccioli or beef ravioli or fettuccine or tortellini or chicken parmesan. Salad? Caesar or Cobb or spinach or antipasto or Buffalo chicken. Which brings us to the main event, pizza, thin crust or thick crust or stuffed in five sizes. How about the Super Six, ""the works."" with sausage, ham, pepperoni, green peppers, mushrooms and cheese. I'm still a creature of habit. Give me a large thin crust pizza with sausage and cheese. Then top off your meal with a deep dish cookie, 1/2 pound of chocolate chip cookie dough baked in a deep dish pizza pan, served warm and smothered with vanilla ice cream topped with whipped cream and mini-chocolate morsels. Yummy. The thing about Aurelio's is you are tempted to sit at the bar and eat your pizza while watching the Bulls or Blackhawks or Cubs on one of the several TVs scattered around the restaurant rather than make an order to-go and take it home. Cheers for the guy who decided to build an Aurelio's in the South Loop."

I ordered the sausage & pepperoni stuffed pizza and was pleasantly surprised. Very good sausage, the pepperoni had a good flavor to it (not bland like what I taste in cheaper pizzas), and the sauce was very good. I placed the order online (this location accepts online orders) and received a confirmation call within minutes.I'm writing this review (and giving them a 5-star rating) to acknowledge the extraordinary service they provided on the delivery. Stuffed pizzas usually take extra time to make, they had to deliver during rush hour on a weekday in Chicago, and they still got it to me within 45 minutes! Not only that, but they meticulously honored every request I made, from extra paper plates, utensils & napkins (the hotel didn't have any of that in the room) to a couple extra Parmesan cheese packets for flavoring.The pizza arrived hot, and I enjoyed a very nice dinner. It wasn't cheap ($18 for a small 10"" stuffed) but it was VERY filling (2 dinners over 2 days.) There was an additional delivery charge of $3, but given the super fast delivery under trying circumstances, and the excellent service including all the extras I asked for, it was well worth it! I would definitely order from them again."

A few nights before I ordered they were featured on a local television station and the food looked awesome. Unfortunately, food that looks good on television does not always taste good. I ordered the paella mariscos (a seafood paella) and it came with saffron rice, shrimp, mussels, clams, scallops, and squid. I ordered mine sans clams. I placed my order over the telephone for pickup. After getting the dish back to my house, I immediately tried it. Simply put, it was not good. It had zero flavor. Anyone who has tried a traditional paella knows that it screams flavor. However, all you could taste with this dish was salt and tomatoes. The squid was rubbery and lacked any flavor. The shrimp and super-tiny scallops also lacked flavor. I have been to Spanish restaurants in Spain in Madrid, Seville, Malaga, etc. I have also dined in an excellent restaurant in the Village in NYC called Sevilla (on Charles Street). I am not holding Tapas Valencia to what I’ve experienced in those places. However, if you’re a Spanish restaurant and you’re serving a truly authentic dish like paellas, then it has to be seasoned well and taste far better than what I experienced on June 24, 2020."

A few nights before I ordered they were featured on a local television station and the food looked awesome. Unfortunately, food that looks good on television does not always taste good. I ordered the paella mariscos (a seafood paella) and it came with saffron rice, shrimp, mussels, clams, scallops, and squid. I ordered mine sans clams. I placed my order over the telephone for pickup. After getting the dish back to my house, I immediately tried it. Simply put, it was not good. It had zero flavor. Anyone who has tried a traditional paella knows that it screams flavor. However, all you could taste with this dish was salt and tomatoes. The squid was rubbery and lacked any flavor. The shrimp and super-tiny scallops also lacked flavor. I have been to Spanish restaurants in Spain in Madrid, Seville, Malaga, etc. I have also dined in an excellent restaurant in the Village in NYC called Sevilla (on Charles Street). I am not holding Tapas Valencia to what I’ve experienced in those places. However, if you’re a Spanish restaurant and you’re serving a truly authentic dish like paellas, then it has to be seasoned well and taste far better than what I experienced on June 24, 2020."

Their sangria is good, and their mojitos were excellent (and I am obsessed with my mojitos, so I was picky—not too sweet, enough mint, properly shaken). This time, I reserved a table in advance, and asked about the paella over the phone, mentioning that it was my birthday. I arrived early and was seated immediately, and the moment my boyfriend arrived, they put in the order for my paella. At the end of the night, they brought me complimentary flan with a candle, remembering from my mention over the phone. They are clearly careful about their service.I had the paella valenciana; the chicken was overcooked, but the seafood is the main point anyway, and the clams, mussels, and shrimp were superb, as well as the rice. I really enjoyed it—it was a great dish, and I'd wanted paella for my birthday, and I was very pleased with the meal. We also had a bunch of tapas, mostly for my boyfriend who wasn't having the paella, but I tried some as well. The Queso de Cabra was a star of the night—absolutely stunningly delicious and satisfying, we scraped every last speck of that sauce out with bread. He loved the Tostada con Pato and Salmón Curado—which were both tasty cooked to perfection—and the Chorizo y Morcilla, although he was disappointed with the regular sausage. The cheese plate was just all right, a bit small and could have used more fruit.Overall, great birthday! I would definitely go there again. Not too busy, but excellent food, service, and drinks."

I chose Tapas Valencia because it got several good reviews and is sort of close to the convention center. When we arrived for lunch at 12:30 there was no one at the host stand or bar to greet us and there was one customer sitting way in back. We stood there for a while then went and found someone who was also sitting way in the back rolling silverware and napkins. I made a reservation the night before but the place was empty and dark and seemed closed. When we were eventually seated the server was nice and polite but very slow. It took about 10 minutes to get our drinks. The food was decent but under seasoned and over-priced. For example: the Jamon Iberico was about 4 slices shabbily placed on a plate with toast for $23.

Chris explained each wine in detail, and then provided a map to show us the region in Spain where each originated. The wines were distinctly different and delicious. We shared Salpicon de Moriscos, a chilled seafood medley that was very fresh and tasty. The generous portion of Trucha a la Plancha, grilled rainbow trout, was perfect.

Their sangria is good, and their mojitos were excellent (and I am obsessed with my mojitos, so I was picky—not too sweet, enough mint, properly shaken). This time, I reserved a table in advance, and asked about the paella over the phone, mentioning that it was my birthday. I arrived early and was seated immediately, and the moment my boyfriend arrived, they put in the order for my paella. At the end of the night, they brought me complimentary flan with a candle, remembering from my mention over the phone. They are clearly careful about their service.I had the paella valenciana; the chicken was overcooked, but the seafood is the main point anyway, and the clams, mussels, and shrimp were superb, as well as the rice. I really enjoyed it—it was a great dish, and I'd wanted paella for my birthday, and I was very pleased with the meal. We also had a bunch of tapas, mostly for my boyfriend who wasn't having the paella, but I tried some as well. The Queso de Cabra was a star of the night—absolutely stunningly delicious and satisfying, we scraped every last speck of that sauce out with bread. He loved the Tostada con Pato and Salmón Curado—which were both tasty cooked to perfection—and the Chorizo y Morcilla, although he was disappointed with the regular sausage. The cheese plate was just all right, a bit small and could have used more fruit.Overall, great birthday! I would definitely go there again. Not too busy, but excellent food, service, and drinks."

I chose Tapas Valencia because it got several good reviews and is sort of close to the convention center.

We stood there for a while then went and found someone who was also sitting way in the back rolling silverware and napkins. I made a reservation the night before but the place was empty and dark and seemed closed. When we were eventually seated the server was nice and polite but very slow. It took about 10 minutes to get our drinks. The food was decent but under seasoned and over-priced. For example: the Jamon Iberico was about 4 slices shabbily placed on a plate with toast for $23.

I've been to almost every tapas restaurant along with those that tend to be lined up on a Friday/Saturday in Chicago like Cafe Babareeba and Iberico, but this spot is my favorite for a few reasons!1 - The food is absolutely delicious. I've never had an ill prepared meal here, you can taste he quality of food in every bite. 2 - it's never packed, but perhaps it should be. The slightly off the beaten path south loop location means you can always walk in and get a table. The ambiance is great too!3 - lastly, it's great value for Chicago! They have great prices every day and on top of that happy hour specials that are hard to beat. Head over on your night out. You will love it here!"

He did recover a bit by bringing out a surprise dessert for the graduate in the group.The atmosphere is fun, great for big groups and colorfully decorated. Patio would be great on a warm evening, but could not accommodate a group of our size (9).The real letdown was the food. It just simply was not as good as other tapas restaurants. The portions were also very small, making items difficult to share, which is usually the idea with tapas. The raw salmon dish we ordered was also turning grey and smelled so fishy several members of the group could not eat it.

The Tempranillo by the glass was a perfect match. Only 2 small caveats: 1) the octopus (spicy and yummy) was fridge-cold, so beware of this; 2) one of the 2 included desserts, the cheesecake, was too heavy and compact: best avoided.

The Montaditas tapa (pork tenderloin cutlets on small slices of bread with a delicious sauce and carmelized thin-sliced onions, are delicious, it's a struggle not to order two portions of those, it's the best tapa they have. The black bean soup with chorizo is delicious also. The lady finds the paella a bit salty, but I've never had bad paella, tasted great to me.We ordered gambas, shrimps in a lemon/butter/garlic sauce, and were disappointed, too much butter, tiny shrimp and only 6 of them for $9.50. We never complain, but I had to. Even though we ate 4 of the 6 shrimp, the house took the shrimp off the bill and apologized. We weren't spending a fortune, only one glass of wine, total, but the manager earned my respect right then and there.I tried the onion soup tapa, and it was disappointing, it was just onion broth with croutons, and the menu said it had Manchego cheese, but I couldn't find any. No problemo, I'll go back to black bean soup.In short, it's possible, I suppose, to have a meal that isn't terrific, if you're unlucky, but we will return often, we're treated with utmost courtesy, by the hostess, manager, and valet parkers, which only charge a reasonable $6.

Wondered if by changing locations things had improved. Atmosphere: We ate outside since the weather was perfect. Road noise was high, but otherwise we had a nice experience. It looked like the inside was decorated nicely - I was surprised they weren't busier on a Sat. night. There aren't many other places around this restaurant, other than condos, so it feels a little isolated. We were told that it's busy with nightlife one block over. Drinks: I had a glass of the red wine sangria, which was good. Food: we ordered goat cheese marinara, spicy potatoes, tiger shrimp with honey sauce, beef empanada, and salmon and cheese rollups. The goat cheese marinara was by far the winner of the bunch, always my favorite. The potatoes were okay, nothing special. I liked the beef empanada, but it was more of a croissant pastry dough rather than the type of dough we're used to. The salmon was good, as was the shrimp. Service: While our waiter was pleasant, we had to ask for him a few times for food, water refills, and our check. They weren't busy at all, so I'm not sure why the service was so slow and inattentive.

(what else?),"This place's location may not be glamorous, but it's worth getting to. Their 4 courses (each included 2-3 tapas) prix-fix menu is what we had (2 are needed to order it): a wide array of succulent tapas sure to please all tastes! The waiter warned us: ""you won't leave hungry!"", and he was right: even though the tapas are by definition small plates, they kept coming and coming, one better than the previous, so it was a feast of flavors. All of them are highly recommended, from the patatas bravas to the lamb with caramelized onions, to the roasted garlic mashed potatoes, to the crispy, tasty tilapia. All fantastic! The Tempranillo by the glass was a perfect match. Only 2 small caveats: 1) the octopus (spicy and yummy) was fridge-cold, so beware of this; 2) one of the 2 included desserts, the cheesecake, was too heavy and compact: best avoided. But overall a great dinner, appropriately priced, in a vibrant atmosphere and with an attentive, friendly service."

Some dishes are better than others, but the staff are warm, friendly, not at all intrusive, and they try very hard. The Montaditas tapa (pork tenderloin cutlets on small slices of bread with a delicious sauce and carmelized thin-sliced onions, are delicious, it's a struggle not to order two portions of those, it's the best tapa they have. The black bean soup with chorizo is delicious also. The lady finds the paella a bit salty, but I've never had bad paella, tasted great to me.We ordered gambas, shrimps in a lemon/butter/garlic sauce, and were disappointed, too much butter, tiny shrimp and only 6 of them for $9.50. We never complain, but I had to. Even though we ate 4 of the 6 shrimp, the house took the shrimp off the bill and apologized. We weren't spending a fortune, only one glass of wine, total, but the manager earned my respect right then and there.I tried the onion soup tapa, and it was disappointing, it was just onion broth with croutons, and the menu said it had Manchego cheese, but I couldn't find any. No problemo, I'll go back to black bean soup.In short, it's possible, I suppose, to have a meal that isn't terrific, if you're unlucky, but we will return often, we're treated with utmost courtesy, by the hostess, manager, and valet parkers, which only charge a reasonable $6. Our visit is always enjoyable, and by the way, the profiterole dessert tapa is wonderful, and a steal at $5.95. Tapas at the bar on certain days are discounted, a wonderful bargain. This cafe tries hard to please, it's a good place for a casual meal."

The Croquetas de Jamon y Pollo had a delicate texture and a complimentary tomato sauce. The roasted dates wrapped in bacon are a MUST-DO. You cannot go wrong with smoky and sweet. The Patatas Bravas were okay. The baked eggplant with tomato, wild mushrooms and Tetilla cheese with a Madiera wine sauce had an interesting flavor but the texture was slimy and unappealing.

Wondered if by changing locations things had improved. Atmosphere: We ate outside since the weather was perfect. Road noise was high, but otherwise we had a nice experience. It looked like the inside was decorated nicely - I was surprised they weren't busier on a Sat. night. There aren't many other places around this restaurant, other than condos, so it feels a little isolated. We were told that it's busy with nightlife one block over. Drinks: I had a glass of the red wine sangria, which was good. Food: we ordered goat cheese marinara, spicy potatoes, tiger shrimp with honey sauce, beef empanada, and salmon and cheese rollups. The goat cheese marinara was by far the winner of the bunch, always my favorite. The potatoes were okay, nothing special. I liked the beef empanada, but it was more of a croissant pastry dough rather than the type of dough we're used to. The salmon was good, as was the shrimp. Service: While our waiter was pleasant, we had to ask for him a few times for food, water refills, and our check. They weren't busy at all, so I'm not sure why the service was so slow and inattentive.

The chilled shrimp in horseradish tomato sauce, the shrimp were a good size. The beef tenderloin with the mushroom and date was mouth-watering. For hot tapas we had a lobster dish that was to die for, the stuffed mushrooms were tasty, the puffed pastry with beef tenderloin will be a repeat dish and the scallops were tender. We had dessert, we had the banana in caramel sauce with chopped pistachio nuts served with ice cream, we had the flan, and we had the bitter sweet chocolate tart..All the desserts were good.

Raphael was our amazing and incredibly attentive waiter. He suggested we start with Tostados de Centollo and helped us choose a delicious Rioja to accompany our meal. Tapas Valencia's menu has all the wonderful tapas we enjoy at Meson Sabika including our favorite Solomillo con Jamon. We went with several family members and shared a great assortment of cold and hot tapas and topped it all off sharing desserts including our favorite Platano con Helado. Though the food is the same, the atmosphere at Tapas Valencia is very different from Meson Sabika. Tapas Valencia is open and airy with vibrantly colored tile mosaics on the walls - modern and fun. Valet parking is offered but we had no difficulty finding street parking on our own. We highly recommend Tapas Valencia - makes heading to the south side of the city worth it!"

Contemporary decor - beautiful mosaic tile walls, high ceiling and open floor plan. The service is everything you'd expect from Meson Sabika, professional, attentive, knowledgeable, just in an urban-chic setting. Jose, the manager, is an expert on Spanish wine as well as food pairings, and he just might be the nicest, most generous restaurant manager in Chicago on top of it! He aims to please at every level and it's clear his staff is trained in the same way.

We shared the puffed pastry with ice cream and chocolate sauce for dessert. Terri was our server and she was attentive and had a delightful personality. When asked about several items due to allergies of members of our group, she checked with the chef to make sure there would be no allergic reaction to specific dishes.The only area that we would like better addressed is the noise level. The entire decor is a non-carpeted floor and wood room dividers with an open ceiling.

I had the Chicago style hot dog with everything on it, but onions and peppers. My husband had the same, except on a veggie dog and onions added to it. I typically only put ketchup and mustard on my dogs (putting ketchup on it is a crime in Chicago), so it was interesting to have different flavors on my hot dog than what I'm used to. It was a good hot dog that tasted more like the ingredients that flavored it than the actual hot dog. The price was a bit high, but it was a good lunch."

Reviews looked good and the concept was interesting- Italian and polish. What was lackluster was the front of the house unable to clear or seat tables. We saw them clear 4 tables, had them ready and the hostess and helper still scrambled to seat people and had them wait. Very frustrating.We ordered the pierogi app and was it mind-blowing- no, good= yes. These were fried so not our fav.The pizza was good, crust tasty and toppings good. But with veggies on it, the pizza did get very wet. Server came around for first round of drinks, then disappeared. She probably would have earned a second round, if she had visited.

Found Flo and Santos within walking distance of the Hilton Chicago. A friendly cheery place. Found a spot at the bar and settled in. Great selection of beers. Menu has a combination of Polish and Italian specialties. I noticed a lot of thin pizza being served but I was looking for something else. The Peirogi sampler, 6 good sized peirogis came on a bed of sauerkraut. 2 each stuffed with potato, kraut and ground pork. They were served with a nice dark applesauce and sour cream for dipping. Excellent starter. Next came a Polish Rueben sandwich. Differs from standard in that it has Krakow ham instead of corned beef and Polish dressing instead of Russian dressing. A good hearty sandwich accompanied by excellent waffle cut fries. I also had an opportunity to taste a teriyaki pork wing. Wow. A dressed and trimmed pork chop marinated in teriyaki sauce. A large meat lollipop meant to be eaten by hand as a starter. Great idea really well executed. Also comes with Buffalo sauce and BBQ. Itws worth the trip tfor the pork wings alone.

I ordered the Italian Beef pizza which was ok, and a whiskey Neat for $12. When I got the check, they had added $2 per drink for the ""neat"". When I asked the server about it she gave me an attitude and said ""it's standard to add $ for neat since we give you more"". In my experience, when I have been to bars (and worked in them too!!) and ordered ""Rocks"" I have seen an additional charge, and each bar maybe has their own way of doing things, but to give a customer attitude like they're an idiot for questioning it is unacceptable. I said it was not listed anywhere on the menu, and she said ""you should have just known, it's pretty standard, do you want me to ask a manager?"" If you're going to add money to a person's check it should either be listed somewhere or you inform the guest when they order. To me, that's ""pretty standard"". I said I would discuss it myself, and when I mentioned it to the manager, he said the same response and ""I have no authority to adjust your check but I'll 'mention it' to the GM"". Ha! A manager on duty with no authority, what a freaking joke!! It comes down to a minimal dollar amount, so I just paid and left, but we were with a large group who work at a large hotel in the area, and needless to say we have the opportunity to refer lots of people to local restaurants.

My sil saw so we treated her for her b-day, driving in from NW Indiana. It's city parking (no lot) so be prepared to circle the block a few times and feed the meter. We arrived approx. 5:15 on a Sat. night so not yet crowded, but sure getting there when we left. It's on a city block, non-descript w/brown awning. Not very ""wide""/large looking on outside, but very long inside. Upon opening the door, the aroma of fresh baked pizza hits your nostrils big time, yum! The bar is on the left. There's plenty of tables/booths and TV's (is sports bar). It was Sat. (diff drink special each day) so its was buckets of reg or Polish beers for $15 (you can NOT mix or match, either reg or Polish), so five 16 oz. for $15, great deal. Has LOTS of beers to choose from, ciders, wines and cocktails. The food is fun and different. They have thing crust pizza (very thin and crispy) and there's 6-7 types to offer or you can create your own. We went w/the kielbasa pizza (polish sausage, sauer kraut and bacon w/pizza sauce), very diff and good, sauer kraut not overpowering and that's good as I'm not a huge fan. $26 for pizza that serves 4-5. They have an entrée called raviogi (sp?) which is meat filled pierogi's (I believe 6) in a creamy vodka sauce - wow, delicious! We asked for plates and all shared it. I don't know as I could eat entire entrée as very rich in taste, but again delish! Our app was polish platter - long link of kielbasa, pickles dotted w/a spice, 3 pierogis (ea diff kind) and a large thick potato pancake. This platter was $14, and while very tasty was overpriced for quantity. I really didn't see that you could get potato pancakes for an entrée, wish you could. DO have pierogi's for app, 6 for $10, pricey. This restaurant is not cheap, but the quality is worth the price. It is Chicago fare after all so what is cheap in Chicago?!?! They've several app's, sandwiches, chick parm, etc. We saw diff food items pass us by and all looked tasty and attractive - waffle fries, chicken parm, salad, onion rings. There were kids in there, lots of TV's and big group so be prepared for noise. Waitress was very efficient and did NOT rush us. ""Bus boys"" were quick to grab dirty plates, bring out clean plates, new napkins, pour water, etc. - very efficient! For desert they have packzi (polish bismarcks - yeast donuts stuffed w/jelly and doused w/sugar) - we did not have. We opted for s'mores pizza - a 12 inch pizza for $6/7 with marshmallows, chocolate and graham cracker crumbs on it - very hot and super messy/gooey and out of this world. Hint: Don't eat immediately, let it cool a bit. EVERY food item we ordered was above and beyond delicious. Flo was a Polish woman marrying an Italian man, hence the Polish/Italian ""marriage"" of the food served here. Bathrooms clean.

They are offered separately or in the case of the Pizza together. We had the pierogi platter which was done just the way I like them..crispy on the outside and moist and flavorful on the inside. I prefer the sauerkraut and potato, the meat option did nothing for me. We also tried the pork wings which were meaty and terrific. We went with the buffalo style and they were flavorful and had no fat to speak of. We also tried the polish platter which had pierogi, sauerkraut, potato pancakes and a big honkin link of smoked polish. The potato pancakes were crisp on the outside and fluffy potatoey on the inside, very good. The polish was of a cheap variety found at art fairs and street fests in the city. It would be better with a higher quality sausage. Our server Rebecca was very good and next time we will try the pizza which looked like terrific thin crust Chicago pizza and smelled even better.

The person on the other end of the line said it had been happening a lot lately and he would replace them, which he did. BUT, when the second ones came, they weren't much better, i.e., SAME PROBLEM. By this time it was almost bedtime, too late to complain any more, so we ate them anyway. Not bad pizza, though. They automatically charged a delivery charge and a tip. Total was $50 for two pizzas.

I get cravings for the Buffalo Bill's chicken pizza, but my favorite combination is fire roasted tomato/carmelized onion/pepperoni. They don't cheap you out on the pepperoni's... cut nice and thick.

Four of us were visiting Chicago. Had a hankering for pirogi, and hotel concierge suggested this place--supposed to have decent pirogi and good pizza to boot. When we get there we find nice seating outside. When you walked in, the place was inviting: nice bar to your left, raised booths on the right. Soft lighting. Nice view of kitchen in back and the place half-filled with locals--which I took as a sign of a well kept secret in the touristy South Loop. Two waitresses and a bartender in the dining area. Looks like a good spot for a few beers, casual food and hanging out. Then this:No host or indication of seat yourself. So, asked the two waitresses if an empty booth was free. We are told no and no other booths are available so we take a table. Turns out that unavailable booth stays empty the whole time we are there. Meanwhile we sit at the table about ten or fifteen minutes and get no menu or waitress. A busboy did give us water, too bad he didn't run the place. Other people enter they get immediate attention from a waitress. I walk over to the bar where the bartender and another waitress are having a seemingly pleasant chat, ask for menus, a waitress. Oh, sorry about that I am told. It takes a few more minutes to get the menus but not before other orders are taken at other tables. Around this time I notice one of the waitresses staring at me from the kitchen at the back of the restaurant while the other waitress walks by and continues to ignore us. Did I mention the place was half-empty? Been about twenty or twenty-five minutes of this nonsense. At this point, we stop being stupid for them and realize our money is not wanted. So we had a fine meal a couple of blocks over at the Eleven Diner.I travel quite a bit and so am routinely exposed to the best, the worst, and the in-between for hotels, visitor services, and restaurants.

They stocked it with plenty of large, flat-screen tvs and a bar with a great list of beers/drafts (cocktail list could use a little improvement). Then, they worked on the food menu. I'm guessing the owners have Polish heritage because that influence is all over the menu. Not complaining, it's just rare to see in the South Loop. Sandwiches are huge, and the pizza is a big draw - thin crust (but not too thin) and enough to feed everyone at the table. However, the thing that keeps me coming back are the the flying pork wings, which come covered in BBQ, buffalo or teriyaki sauce and waffle fries, which come topped with bacon and your choice of blue cheese or cheddar. All in all I'd say Flo & Santos is the best pub in the South Loop!"

Modern, fresh Italian & Polish fare in family friendly sports bar-ish restaurant.","Hummus &Veggie plate & Pierogi appetizer were plenty for a light dinner for two @ 6:00p on a Friday night. Already had a short wait for a table so we sat at the bar. No problem getting full food service there. Informal, whatever makes you happy kind of atmosphere and service. Service could have been a little faster but our server got alot of customers right after we arrived and we were eating at the bar so it was ok. Cozy, contemporary neighborhood restaurant. Brick walls, wood furniture, big screen Tvs for sports. At that time of night the crowd was mixed with couples and families. Probably turns more sports bar-like as the night goes on. You can see into the kitchen somewhat over the wall in the back. It looked like seriously professional food prep going on back there, and it showed in the food quality, presentation, and taste. Everything we had was fresh, beautiful, and very tasty. The Pierogis were light and delicious. Can't wait to go back. Would love to try their Bruschette, Chicken Parmesan, Ravirogi, or Fish or Pasta of the day."

So I couldn’t even pick the damn burrito up. I called and I was offered a chance to bring the burrito back and have it remade. Yes, I just LOVE having to go out of my way after paying $30.00 for two f up burritos, to make a second trip to a restaurant in order to have the food I paid for made properly. I’m so over the poor management, poor customer service, weak unseasoned food and I’m definitely sick of having to babysit these grown as restaurants. You all know better.

The ironic thing is that the food was some of the best Mexican we have ever had. We dined here twice, once with me and hubby and another time with a third person, a friend/co-worker. The first time I had the mini quesadillas, hubby had the enchiladas and our friend had the Taquitos. When asked how everyone would rate the food, it was a resounding 5/5. Being not that hungry, the mini quesadillas were just enough, not overly huge portions, but there were probably about 10-12 small triangles of cheesy heaven. The enchiladas were 3 chicken enchiladas with a decent amount of cheese and sauce and not spicy. The rice was some of the best any of us have ever had, with peas/carrots and other things. Spanish rice. The beans were refried beans and nice for dipping chips. They were the right consistency too. The second visit had us trying a steak burrito and the ground beef taco meal. I am drooling thinking about this food… The burrito was delicious with tender, quality cuts of meat and fresh ingredients. The tacos were excellent too, along with more of their yummy rice and beans. The service was pretty good with frequent drink refills although a little less quick during the first visit. Servers were all very friendly though. The restaurant itself is not very big, kind of long and narrow, and the first visit had us sitting pretty close to our neighbors. If that type of seating makes you feel like your space bubble would be infringed upon, ask to be seated on the left side of the restaurant where it did not feel as cramped.There is also a bar on the right side of the restaurant and outside seating.Even though it is pretty far from Wheaton, I am sure we will be going back to this restaurant."

I was seated on the outside small patio on Michigan Avenue. It took a very long time to get 2 standard tacos on the lunch special. Then I had to literally walk inside to get my check. I asked the busboy if he could get my waiter to bring my check. You would think he would have run inside immediately and brought it out or had the waiter bring it to me.

I figured a place named ""La Cantina"" would be too Americanized for my taste. I was wrong! As a very frequent traveller to Mexico, I know authentic Mexican food as well as anybody, and this place is as authentic as you'll find in the US. The tacos al pastor were amazing, and just like the al pastor you get in the streets of Mexico City. The queso fondito was also VERY good. The margaritas were excellent as well. The only down side was the noise...it is a VERY noisy restaurant."

At 6 pm it was crowded but got a table right away. Sangria was delicious, chimichanga appetizer was super delicious and filling enough that we cancelled one of our entrees. Also orderded steak quesadillas which were delicious! My only regret was not trying the margaritas which looked delicious being served at the bar. They also play great spanish music, not mariachi at all. The server was a little rough around the edges but perfectly competent. Great atmosphere for dates but also outings with friends. Will be going back as soon as I can!"

I wasn't in the mood to navigate downtown or north side traffic so decided to focus on the south loop area. After checking out reviews on Yelp, I decided to go for La Cantina Grill. We were not disappointed. We went on a misty Saturday night around 10:30 p.m. Three of us and we were seated immediately. The place is somewhat small so definitely rubbing elbows and can hear some other table conversation, but it's not a nuisance. I ordered quesadillas, one friend got fish tacos, the other got one chicken and two pork tacos. We also did the pitcher of Sangria, which is $13 on Saturdays. Everyone loved their food and, with my help, there wasn't an empty plate left. Our server and bus boys were just incredible. I've never been to a restaurant where the person asks before removing anything from the table. ""May I pour another glass?"" ""Would you like me to take your plate?"" Before they touched the table, they always asked permission and while that not necessary for me, I did appreciate it. if I had children, I wouldn't bring them here after 7 p.m. Besides the fact they should be home winding down, you get the vibe (on my Saturday visit) is geared more towards friends' night later in the evening. The music was Top 40s and some latin hits. We saw one couple and the rest were girlfriends or pairs of friends enjoying a Saturday night.This is my new go-to for Mexican food and where I'll be bringing my friends for a fun, yet easy, night out. I recommend."

They were swearing (and there was young children around) and shouting obscenities to each other just for attention - the staff received multiple complaints and did nothing. Food was ok however an 18% tip was added - this disgusts me as I feel a tip is optional and should be given for good service. Adding a tip on is ridiculous!Avoid this place!!

We all ordered different food. I thought the chips tasted horrible, but the salsa was decent. All of my coworkers liked the chips. I ordered the lunch chimi. It was completely flavorless and had so much cheese, it was too much? I have never said that before, but the cheese was inside and didnt mesh with the overcooked chicken. I took one bite of the rice - no flavor. Then I took a bite of the beans, again - no flavor. The best thing about the lunch was the guac on top which was a small amount. I think all of my coworkers had a decent experience. I did not."

I told the waitress we were in kind of a hurry since we had to take someone to the airport. We had a Groupon which included two margaritas, any appetizer, and any two entrees. We each had regular margaritas which were large, and tasted great. The shrimp cocktail was awesome. It must have had 10 jumbo shrimp mixed in with a red sauce. The entrees came shortly after the appetizer which was great since we were in a hurry. We each had fajitas. We travel to Mexico alot and I commented to my wife that this was the best Mexican food we'd had in a long long time. The service was great, we were out of the place in under an hour. The atmosphere of the restaurant was very good and the food presentation was outstanding. We will definitely be going back again."

Starting with the waitress: She was extra nice and kind, very helpful at multiple levels, which is why I happily gave her a $12.00 tip. Only improvement she could have done was to ensure hotter coffer, it was too warm to my taste. However, upon request she did provide me with a very hot cup of coffee, problem solved. Feedback on the Food and other staff: The food could have been MORE hotter, as my baked or smothered potatoes, from ordering a skillet, were not hot, more like a tad above warm. I did not want to complain or send it back so I did not mention that I would have enjoyed more hotter food. Next: The restaurant closes at 3pm. I was aware of that prior to selecting this restaurant. The real issues to me began at this point: After I paid my bill and tip, the service went to an all-time low. It was 2:40pm (which I checked my cell phone time) - A guy walked up to the TV that we were sitting directly under and was clearly watch and turned it off (but left the TV near the BAR on). This guy did not say one word to me or my family, he just turned it off. He did not bother to put two words together to say, “May I turn off this TV, if you are not watching it?” He said nothing to us at all. Again, it is 2:40pm. As he walked away, I said, “ Excuse me Sir, we were still watching the TV.” He said, “We are about to close at 3pm.” I said, “We are still customers, plus it is not technically 3pm, can you please turn the TV back on?” He honored my request with an attitude. About 2 minutes went by and he then began to clean the floors and tables, which is understandable. However I did not appreciate or expect this guy to start sweeping the floors right up next to my table were we were still clearing eating. Have he ever heard of air floating dust, traveling lint! Next he started mopping the floor all around us, and on top of that he mop had an bad order/smell, that even my child instantly said, ""Mom, what is that smell, it stinks."" It was not a smell you wanted to smell while eating food! The guy had a clear disposition on him like we (my family) were no longer welcomed to finish enjoying our meal without any interruptions. His body language spoke very well by saying, “It is time to go and I am not planning to say one half of a second over 3:00pm!” We actually exited the restaurant at 2:58pm, not a moment past 3:00pm. This was the very first time we ate at this restaurant and we felt grossly disrespected at multiple levels, for no reason. This was reported today to Restaurant.com, which we were using our $100 gift certificate from them. Date of visiting Chicago Waffle, 1400 S. Michigan Ave: 6/12/2019."

Feedback on the Food and other staff: The food could have been MORE hotter, as my baked or smothered potatoes, from ordering a skillet, were not hot, more like a tad above warm. I did not want to complain or send it back so I did not mention that I would have enjoyed more hotter food. Next: The restaurant closes at 3pm. I was aware of that prior to selecting this restaurant. The real issues to me began at this point: After I paid my bill and tip, the service went to an all-time low. It was 2:40pm (which I checked my cell phone time) - A guy walked up to the TV that we were sitting directly under and was clearly watch and turned it off (but left the TV near the BAR on). This guy did not say one word to me or my family, he just turned it off. He did not bother to put two words together to say, “May I turn off this TV, if you are not watching it?” He said nothing to us at all. Again, it is 2:40pm. As he walked away, I said, “ Excuse me Sir, we were still watching the TV.” He said, “We are about to close at 3pm.” I said, “We are still customers, plus it is not technically 3pm, can you please turn the TV back on?” He honored my request with an attitude. About 2 minutes went by and he then began to clean the floors and tables, which is understandable. However I did not appreciate or expect this guy to start sweeping the floors right up next to my table were we were still clearing eating. Have he ever heard of air floating dust, traveling lint! Next he started mopping the floor all around us, and on top of that he mop had an bad order/smell, that even my child instantly said, ""Mom, what is that smell, it stinks."" It was not a smell you wanted to smell while eating food! The guy had a clear disposition on him like we (my family) were no longer welcomed to finish enjoying our meal without any interruptions. His body language spoke very well by saying, “It is time to go and I am not planning to say one half of a second over 3:00pm!” We actually exited the restaurant at 2:58pm, not a moment past 3:00pm. This was the very first time we ate at this restaurant and we felt grossly disrespected at multiple levels, for no reason. This was reported today to Restaurant.com, which we were using our $100 gift certificate from them. Date of visiting Chicago Waffle, 1400 S. Michigan Ave: 6/12/2019."

The waiters were so friendly and accommodating. Luckily it wasn't as packed as the day before,on Sunday, when we walked by and saw a long line of people waiting. The waiters had time to chat, we talked about more than just the food, we got to meet the owner of the restaurant, and simply enjoyed the experience. Now, about the food... the carrot-coconut-waffle with candied walnuts was to die for. It came with real, homemade AMAZING whipped cream, like you don't usually find in brunch restaurants. The Beny with Corned beef hash was delicious. Came with a big cup of very fresh fruit. The Avocado Sandwich was great, everything so fresh and tasty. And the cappuccino was good. We used to go to Yolk for brunch when we visited Chicago, but I think we may have found our new brunch place!"

The ham and cheese omelette was good, not dry, but the toast was burnt.

We ordered 2 chicken & waffles and 1 short rib & waffles...received 3 chicken & waffles...and they were the saddest plates of food I've seen in a long time. 2 chicken tenders (frozen that you can buy in the store) & 1 piece of bacon on the blandest waffle (even with syrup & butter) was so disappointing, we threw them in the garbage. Thankfully, we got a credit for the missing short rib waffle to make up for some of the money wasted on this garbage."

The service is horrendous and the food is gross. My niece and I both ordered Huevos Ranchero and the menu said black beans, rice and green tomatillo sauce. When we received it, the black beans looked like a soup, the rice was hard and the sauce was RED. So...I told them I couldn’t eat it. They came back and gave me the correct sauce but instead put the “black bean watery mush” in a bowl. I lost my appetite as it was so disgusting. We were at a “communal” table and shared it with a party of 5. We had a party of 4. The waitress talked to both groups separately and clearly knew we were not together. When she asked me if it was separate checks or all together, I said all together...THINKING SHE WAS ASKING ABOUT MY PARTY OF FOUR. Afterwards when we asked for our check, she said she already gave it and pointed to the other party at our communal table. That’s when both parties said “we don’t know eachother.” She tried to blame me and said “you told me all together.” Umm...yeah for MY party...I’m NOT paying for strangers. The icing on the cake was at the cashier. I gave my corrected bill to pay. THANK GOD I ALWAYS look at my bill. When I looked at it, I noticed that it was $17.35 more. I mentioned to the cashier that she gave me the wrong bill. She said, “what? I just gave it to you.” I told her that it was wrong and pointed to my bill. That’s when she said nonchalantly, “oh I charged someone else’s bill on yours. I’ll void it and charge yours.” I asked when the other charge would drop off, she said “Monday” like it was no big deal. She’s lucky I have money in my account otherwise, waiting for $70 to drop off of my card would be an issue. When I asked for a receipt stating that she voided the amount, she said, “I already voided it.” I told her “I get that but I need something in writing in case I need to dispute this if it doesn’t fall off.” That’s when she RUDELY told me, “Relax...I’ll get it for you.”WE ONLY CAME HERE BECAUSE THE WAIT FOR YOLK WAS 45 MINUTES and my 15 year old has come here a few times with her HS friends because she likes the waffles. After today’s hellish experience, I told her that she is forbidden to give this establishment any more of our money. I will be sharing this with EVERYONE I know. I’ve NEVER had such an all around horrible experience."

The prices were very reasonable, especially for the amount of food we received. Keep in mind that this restaurant is only open for breakfast and lunch and closes during the late afternoon. This restaurant is on Michigan Avenue and is convenient for anyone who may be walking to the Field Museum, Shedd Aquarium or planetarium if they are staying in the South Loop area of Chicago.

I ordered pancakes on the side and what can I say, it's soft and fluffy, like a pillow of goodness. The place is crowded all the time but service is quick and wait staff are very attentive. Definitely recommend this place."

In another inexplicable accomplishment, they somehow managed to dry out the chicken while leaving the breading barely cooked. The chicken was downright pale. Waffle was barely cooked and mushy. The waiter made a special point to tell us that my meal was normally $12.95. I was unhappy at the $5.99 that I did pay - if I had paid $12.95 I would not have been so friendly nor generous with the tip (despite the waiter forgetting both our coffees). Perhaps we had the ""b"" team, but with only two other tables in the entire restaurant, if this is the best level of consistency they can manage, they stop focusing on trying to be ""special"" and just try to be good."

Ordered the bacon waffles. Thought that would be the best of both worlds. Bacon was in the waffle batter. It wasn't too terrible unless you got a piece of fatty bacon. I ordered the regular syrup with it though. I believe it comes with some spicy syrup of some sort. My husband got an omelet that came with sides. Plenty of food! He ordered a cappuccino, which tasted awful. Tasted burnt and had entirely too much foam. I opted to play it safe with juice.Overall, I would eat here again but choose a different meal."

I even tried to eat it, but...chives. And bananas. I could have overlooked the raw not-walnuts...but not freaking chives and bananas together on a plate.There were only a few pieces of chives in there, but it was obvious that someone in the kitchen had chopped up some onions and then used the knife for the bananas as well. The flavor of chive was definitely in there. And I have no idea how the nuts got messed up. I felt horrible about it but had to send it back, and got the liege waffles instead. Once again (see Yelp reviews) they were not prepared correctly and didn't have the sugar inside, and were also very dry and crumbly. My boyfriend also had liege waffles. This restaurant is one of his favorites, yet he agreed that they were not very good.I don't know what's going on at this place, but it seems to be going downhill.

It's on a quieter side of the city ...residential.  We took a chance on Waffles and was pleasantly surprised. It was a good filling Brunch experience. First, Any BYOB is a plus for New Yorkers. To have a restaurant that encourages you to bring your bottle and enjoy is A+ in our book. The menu selection is pretty straight forward ( Breakfast or Lunch items) and the waiter was pleasant and helpful. We decided on Red Velvet Waffles w/ Chicken (2 piece dark chicken) and Chocolate Waffles with a Chicken Breast. Both entrees were served promptly and were delicious. I really don't understand such mixed reviews! We arrived on a Sunday morning about 11 am and the place was packed. Water and coffee was promptly refilled as well. It's not the best Chicken and Waffles I've had, but the experience was pleasant, moderately priced and you can bring you own bottle of whatever ($5.00 fee)."

I have been here a few times and have never been disappointed. My family and foodie friends have been impressed with their food and service as well. They are able to accommodate larger groups and small children, a big plus for a casual restaurant. I have tried several of their waffles, but they also excel in their non-waffles offerings. My recommendation is: get waffles if that's what drew you here in the first place, else order with confidence whatever else catches your fancy. It's hard to go wrong at Waffles!"

We had a chicken parmigiana and a Gnocchi. The chicken, which is supposed to be crispy, was drenched in marinara which rendered it quite soggy, not what you'd expect for $22. The gnocchi was more like soup of microwaved gnocchi. The thing was drowning in a very thin sauce that literally submerged all of the gnocchi. The crumbled sausage was nowhere to be found. Flavor wasn't awful, but it was very clearly microwaved. Certain areas were warm-ish, other areas were scalding hot. Add to that the soupy sauce that it was drowned in and you have a clear case of microwaved food. Again, not what you'd expect for $22. Refills on drinks or comments about the food were not possible as our server was M.I.A. during the entire duration of our meal. It was a stretch of over 30 minutes that she never came over to us. After we were done eating we had to wait another long while for her to come over and pack our food and give us the check. 'At this point my dining partner was just absolutely fed up with this experience (her last night in the States and she wanted a nice Italian dining experience). She went up to the waitress while we were on our way out and asked for the manager. She gave a smirk and went over to get him. As my dining partner went over what was wrong with the manager, only two things happened: the only words to come out of his mouth were ""oh i'm sorry,"" and he was smirking, bordering on smiling, the entire time. What that was all about is beyond me. I don't know if the pair were high, friends protecting each other or more, who knows. All i know is that this is the last time we're going here. I know it's convenient for us south looper's when we don't feel like trekking out to the north side, but do yourself a favor, don't go here, make the trek up to the north side or UKV and have some real italian food that's actually good and that comes along with actual service."

In fact, we opted to order many of the same things she had. It's an Italian restaurant with old-country charm and atmosphere located at 1924 South State Street, somewhere between South Loop and Chinatown. In Chicago, there are as many Italian restaurants touting authentic old-world recipes as there are hot dog joints and pizza parlors and steakhouses. Well, Cafe Bionda is one of the better ones. From the jumbo shrimp cocktail to the antipasto salad to the veal saltimbocca to the tiramisu, it was a four-star experience. First-time diners are impressed with the opening salvo, a steaming hot bowl of tomato sauce, the top dusted with Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. Love the Orecchiette sausage, a spicy Italian sausage, chili, rapini and garlic. And the calamari fra diavolo, a bed of springy linguine noodles with a helping of tender calamari and red pepper-laced white wine sauce. This from a guy who rebelled when he learned for the first time that calamari was another word for squid. Tuesday's special, cavatelli al forno, is highly recommended, a red sauce-tossed pasta oven baked in its bowl so the blanket of cheese on top can get melty and blend with the house-made, hand-rolled, finger-length cavatelli noodles. Three favorites are the veal Braciole platter, which is simmered in home-made marinara sauce, and the linguine, shrimp and broccoli dish, jumbo Gulf shrimp and broccoli florets tossed with garlic and olive oil over a bed of linguine and, of course, spaghetti and meatballs. Call me a traditionalist but how can you pass up spaghetti and meatballs at an Italian restaurant? Lunch at Cafe Bionda is an enjoyable occasion, too. Try the Italian submarine sandwich, hot or cold, which features capricola, sopresetta, mortadella and provolone with sliced tomato, lettuce and red wine vinaigrette. Or the Bionda burger, a 12-ounce piece of prime ground beef topped with cheddar cheese, bacon and Russian dressing on a pretzel roll. Or the Meatball Bomber, home-made meatballs with marinara and cheese on French bread. Or for those of us who subscribe to a more fish/less meat diet, the Tilapia sandwich, with a breaded Costa Rican tilapia on an Italian roll with lettuce, tomato and lemon garlic aioli. Thanks, Brittney, for tipping us off to a really good dining experience."

We had a so-so experience last year (bad fish) and decided to give it another try. Well, I can say it's officially out of our Rolodex. It's unfortunate because we had so many memories there. But the tumultuous ownership/management situation has finally caught up to them. We brought our own wine, bottle of 2004 merlot and the waiter cracked the cork. He wasn't careful with it after I told him what year it was. So there was that whole fiasco. He waived the corkage fee like it was a big deal. Please, you messed up I expect it to be waived. He should have known. He was quite ditzy the whole night. Food was fine. Wife ordered the gnocchi and loved it. I have to say my biggest gripe is that they don't have fresh Parmesan anymore to grate. What the... How do you consider yourself an Italian restaurant and not grate fresh Parmesan. They put a shaker on the table. No. Unacceptable. Pizza place okay. Not for fine Italian. I don't know what they are thinking but they lost some loyal south loopers. On the bright side, they expanded into the next door unit so the dining room is huge. I'm guessing the cost cutting is due to the expansion. Maybe they hedged a little too much and are crunching in other places. I don't know. "

The waiter was rushed, and the person who cleared the table muttered unintelligibly. They did go the extra mile to help us flag down a taxi, so I can only imagine that it gets better if they recognize you."

Having lived here my whole life (30+), there are a ton of Italian restaurants in the city that I enjoy visiting. Cafe Bionda has been my most visited in the past 3 years. In my opinion, it is one of the 3 best Italian Restaurants in the city if not the best. My favorite dish is the Rigatoni Genovese, which is basically rigatoni with spicy crumbled sausage.....KILLER! The Banana Peppers appetizer and the Calamari Calabrese are also very excellent dishes. They also have an excellent bar area in case your table isn't ready which it won't be on a Friday or Saturday."

Cafe Bionda is by far our favorite Italian restaurant in Chicago...and there are some outstanding restaurants here. We found Cafe Bionda about 6 years ago and have gone back at least 2 times a month since. Of all the meals we have had there, I have NEVER had even a marginal dinner. They are always fantastic and extremely consistent. The chef is great with fish, steaks, chops and their specials are wonderful. Besides the food, there is one thing that keeps us coming back and his name is Guy. Guy is an outstanding waiter and always remembers our preferences and makes great suggestions. If you want something creative that is off the menu, chances are they'll be able to whip it up for you. As long as Cafe Bionda (and Guy) is there, we will keep coming back."

And the homemade fettuccine was wonderful. On my second trip, however, the service was awful. I had the impression that my server did not care to give me good service because I was alone. She was engaged in lively conversation with the table right next to me while she neglected me almost entirely even after I attempted some light banter with her myself. She got part of my order wrong and after she asked if I needed anything and I indicated that I needed a water refill, she forgot to do it!! Once again, I had the delicious Bionda Salad. This time I chose the stuffed shells for my entree. Wow...talk about cheese overkill. WAY to rich for my blood. I think next time I go I will stick with the salad and an appetizer as the salad is large."

We found the restaurant in a very strange way - we were looking for a place to have a dinner for my son on his graduation from U. Chicago, but every place we called was booked. Finally, the maitre-d' at one of the sold-out restaurant recommended Cafe Bionda. Pretty good recommendation.We didn't know what to expect, but we didn't need to worry. First, the atmosphere is very much like an Italian cafe. A little noisy at times, but very comfortable.The food is simply delicious. We served our 27 guests appetizers (calamari and meatballs), a main course (chicken & penne a la vodka & salad) and dessert (tiramisu) and it was all simply delicious.The service was exceptional. From working with the restaurant on the menu before the event to getting the food on time (especially since we had 8 hungry kids with us!), everything went smoothly.Of course, many restaurants can do a great job serving basic Italian food to a party. But this one really went above and beyond. Graduation day was jam-packed with activities, and some of our guests didn't get a chance to eat between breakfast and dinner. One of them - my uncle - was feeling light-headed when dinner began. He went outside to get some fresh air and promptly fainted. (He is on blood pressure medicine and had not eaten all day.) He was fine, but it took a while to get him back on his feet. The whole time, the Cafe Bionda staff and management were on hand, bringing us everything we needed and being very helpful at every turn. Then, when he and his wife decided they wanted to eat outside where it was a little cooler, the restaurant quickly accommodated them without missing a beat.That's the kind of thoughtful service that you simply don't see much of these days. So next time you're in Chicago, try this restaurant. I am sure you will not be disappointed. It made a great day for my family even better."

A nice touch at the beginning of dinner was a basket of hot bread and a bowl of warm marinara sauce to to dip it into. We had a chopped salad that was huge - more than enough for 2 to share. Delicious pasta, great wine list and a fabulous roasted chicked - moist on the inside, crispy on the outside. Our biggest regret was being too full for dessert. Great service, our very efficient server offered to get us a cab as she poured our second cup of coffee. Prices were excellent."

The supporting staff was awesome, never letting our water glasses get below about 1/4 down from full.  The atmosphere was good, but I will say that our table just in front of the bar was a bit noisy, and cool due to the close proximity to the door (it was super cold out, so understandable, just know what you're dealing with when you get seated up there).  Perhaps ask for a table in the rear of the restaurant.  The meal itself was excellent. Get the lobster bisque!!!! You won't be disappointed!I chose the bone in aged ribe eye.  To say it was good would be an understatement.  It's pricey ($70), but if you enjoy a good piece of meat, cooked to absolute perfection - I woudln't hesitate.  My wife had the grouper... and it was also fantasti, with excellent flavor.  We had two sides... one was acorn squash which I'd highly recommend.  The other was a loaded backed potatoe (easily fed two, and could probably feed more!), but for me, it had an almost overpowering amount of garlic in it.  Good, but I would probably opt for the sauteed mushrooms next time.    Dessert was great... Irish creme brulee... very good, and the size was perfect to share for two.

Actually, she was and I was there to gain 10 pounds and see every musuem I could.    I have a old friend from Alaska, where I...live, that moved just outside the city.  I invited him out for dinner and asked for suggestions somewhat close to the convention center where we were staying.  He said he had heard good things about the old Firehouse.  We gave it a try and are we glad we did.  First off, the building is fantastic.  It is important to save landmarks and make them available for people to see.  The artistry and craftsmanship of this structure is fantastic and if you just pop in to take a peek, it will be worth it.  The place is open and has more light than other ""traditional"" steak houses.  We were there on a Friday night at around 8:00 pm, and the place was hopping.  We had cocktails at the bar before dinner.  The bar was lively and the bartenders in good spirits, joking and telling stories while dispensing libations in short order.    When we got our table it was upstairs and towards the back.  This place is way bigger than one would expect.  Our waiter was exceptional.  I cannot emphasize this enough. HIs extensive knowlege of the menu and wines available was noteworthy.  I have since bought a number of bottles of the wine he recommend that night.  My wife and I shared the Tomahawk for two.  Outstanding!  I believe my friend got the New York as he likes his steaks on the just over medium side.    We had more bottle of wine that I would like to admit.  We stayed past closing and shot the ""uknowwhat"" with the waiter and other staff.  I guess being from Alaska is a novelty and with three very well lubricated storytellers the conversations carried themselves.   The Chicago Firehouse may not be on the list for the Best steak in Chicago, but it should be for the whole package.

But we went on two different occasions, once to sample the widely publicized burger at the bar and the seven-course tasting menu that costs $185 per person. Located at 1638 South Wabash Avenue in Chicago's South Loop, it is an upscale restaurant serving North American dishes inspired by chef Ryan McCaskey's background in coastal Maine. His culinary brilliance has earned two Michelin stars. Enough said about the quality of the operation. Open at 5:30 p.m. Wednesday and Thursday and at 5 on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, Acadia has been attracting rave notices since 2011. Be sure to try the burger. It's only served at the bar. It features two patties, gruyere, bacon onion jam, truffle mornay and pickles. I'm not big on tasting menus--it's fun for the chef, who loves to create many new dishes but I usually prefer lots of a few things rather than bits of many things--but McCaskey's version is comparable to Patrick O'Connell's tasting menus at the Inn at Little Washington and Patrick has three Michelin stars. We especially enjoyed the black bass, Maine lobster, smoked potato, scallop, buttermilk biscuit, lamb, coconut sorbet and black sesame custard. Tasting menus are becoming more and more popular at upscale restaurants so we have to get used to it."
Acadia,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g35805-d2511209-Reviews-Acadia-Chicago_Illinois.html,"December 12, 2019",2,Huge disappointment,"Overall, very disappointing. My husband and I have eaten at Michelin star restaurants before, and we were expecting Michelin quality. The service was great but the food was underwhelming and sometimes almost inedible. The ice cream sandwich with caviar made no sense, and there was no taste of caviar in the dish. The main lamb course had absolutely no flavor; it was barely seasoned. The potatoes were undercooked in the “breakfast” dish. The dessert at the end was inedible. It was supposed to be a sea buckthorn berry dish; however it had no taste of the berry whatsoever. This sounds very harsh but the dish honestly tasted like mouthwash. The lobster and squash dishes were good but that’s only 2/10 dishes!! In addition, the meal as a whole had no cohesiveness whatsoever. We were incredibly disappointed and we were not expecting this for a Michelin 2 star restaurant, and now wondering about the quality of the Michelin rating system. In addition, the meal was >$500, so I would have expected much better quality. Definitely not worth it and I would never go back."

Lots of room for improvement.,"Okay here it goes my serious review of Acadia. For some background, I’m an avid restaurant goer and have dined high end and low end across the world. I live on the west coast and my palette is generally craving for freshness and flavours that are not overpowering. Over the years, I have dined in Michelin one to three star restaurants, including 2-3 star highlight tasting menus at Arzak in San Sebastián, Michael Mina in Vegas, L’Atelier de Joel Robuchon in Paris and Guy Savoy in Paris. My experience at Acadia was overall a positive one. The service was absolutely superb even though I have have been served by all of the six servers at the restaurant throughout the meal. They seem to take a team approach rather than a personal approach which I didn’t mind at all because each one of them were professional, courteous, friendly and attentive. Nope, I didn’t get paid or had given anything bonus (not even the wagu beef) to say this.So I have much to say about the food. The diplomatic way is to say that there is much to improve. There’s so much to improve but the food is good, don’t get me wrong, but I probably won’t return for it. My favorites were the fois gras and truffle dish which had corn and blueberries at the bottom. I thought that the blueberries were a surprise and a nice move. I also liked the smoked scallop and tomato dish even though the “smoke” flavour was a little boring. The tomatos were super delicious. The sheet pasta with lobster and king crab dish was not bad (even though it was underwhelming since I own a pasta machine and I can definitely copy this at home). The white asparagus was too old and I had to spit out two pieces. The matcha bread I liked. The fermented corn ice cream with roasted corn I was pleasantly happy with. I absolutely loved loved loved the final donut with caramel. That was a perfect echo to the first dish and tribute to Chicago style churros and caramel popcorn. The meal really should have ended there and I thought the last McDonald’s looking berry tart that came with the bill was not necessary. Here are the parts where they can improve on. The risotto was way too salty. I sent it back once and the second time was almost just as salty. They timed it perfect at al dente but was way too heavy handed with the salt or picked a cheese that was too salty. The duck was cooked so so, had a good portion, but that miso and curry combo really really was screaming for acid. The confit potato in that dish made me yawn. That dish was screaming loudly for some pear or apple, or even apricots. The main entree was underwhelming. The pork many ways was alright, very “Chicago” which I appreciated, but you expect everything to come at the right temperature when you dine at a Michelin Star restaurant. Everything on my dish was about room temperature to cold, so it was not really a main course I would jump up for. Finally, In my opinion the meal lacked cohesiveness and progression. I liked the “donuts” at the beginning and end, but dishes in between did not have anything to do with each other. The foie gras dish was just added to where it is probably because it is a cold dish. It was a little frustrating. The pastries were also quite frustrating. For example, in the pork many ways entree, I didn’t understand what the two breads had to do with each other and what they had to do with the pork dish. What was that piece of seaweed doing in that butter other than it being something Japanese just like matcha in the matcha bread. Finally, the water drop at pudding at dessert was funny to see in a two star Michelin restaurant. It is a snack in Asian cities that you eat on the street or in street markets (low end food), and it’s a fad that’s dying. It could have been elevated but I didn’t think they did other than added some micro flowers.All in all, I must end at a positive note and say that Acadia is not as bad as all the reviews on Tripadvisor. I didn’t have to spend an extra penny considering the ticket online already included tax and gratuity. Is it two star Michelin? Probably not yet in my opinion, but I think overall it was still a decent meal. Was it “wow”? I think foodies out there have been spoiled. There were some slight wow moments for me from a few dishes but overall it was “alright, not bad”."

We went with the tasting menu with all the add ons and everything was amazing. Each dish was incredible both to the eyes and mouth. I also enjoyed the wine pairing with it and that really made the flavors pop! If I were to do it again I would split the add ons as we couldn't finish all the food.

The short rib was served well done and lacked flavor, The deserts were bland--an avocado sorbet with a vanilla cream and flavor-less caviar. and a strawberry duck yolk with an odd texture. Glad I didnt have to pay what I hear is an outrageous price for tasteless one bite morsels."

It is an understatement to say that we unhappily surprised by both the subpar food and service. The highlights of the meal were a little bread roll (combination brioche + croissant) offered towards the beginning of the meal, and the lobster course... that's 1 course out of 10!!! It isn't that the rest was all bad; it's just that the food was unremarkable at best, and out of balance at worst. We never did find the foie gras in the 3rd course. I tasted each offering and the waiters happily cleared my uneaten portions from the table without asking about why they were not eaten. My husband and I have eaten in many Michelin starred restaurants all around the world and at many small establishments that have great service. There is no excuse for a restaurant of this caliber to be so bad at serving a meal, especially when almost everyone is being served the same 10 courses! We started the evening with a female waitress who served a couple of courses. All of the other courses were served by other, varying waiters. This would have been fine if it had been properly choreographed; but it resulted in uneven timing and no one really keeping track of the overall experience. The female server returned at the end of the evening and was surprised to learn of our unhappiness, stating that she wished that she had known earlier... we wished that she had known earlier too! The ambiance was the saving grace of the evening (lovely dining room and quiet enough to hear one another). You can imagine our surprise when the check arrived with tax and gratuity already included and not discernible. We agree with other recent Trip Advisor ratings (e.g., ""Expensive and Disappointing"", ""Falls way short of Expectations"", etc) and we will not return. In all, dinner cost $575 (we brought our own bottle of wine) and we actually went home hungry... that is a real shame."

Acadia is ""1/2 the price"" (so it's still expensive), but pretty easy to forget. -- Service was good, but, again, it should be Outstanding. Certain servers explained courses better than others. Drinks were expensive and acceptable. We ordered the wine pairing with dinner and it was ""ok""... wines were good, but nothing that made you take notice (other than the pricing of the wine pairing)... definitely wouldn't opt for that again. Just order a bottle of nice wine and be done with it. Courses were very small and interesting... some were delicious, others just ok. Again, difficult to make everything served a 10-out-of-10, but expectations are high(er) here. So shouldn't everything be a 10-out-of-10??

Acadia,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g35805-d2511209-Reviews-Acadia-Chicago_Illinois.html,"April 21, 2019",3,Expensive and Disappointing,"This was my first time at this restaurant. I don't usually eat at Michelin rated eateries so I was excited about this reservation.My spouse and I were here for the Easter brunch buffet. In general I don't like buffets for many reasons. Nevertheless, based on reviews and the Michelin rating I thought the food here would be upscale and the menu would include items I have not tried before. There was a practical but limited selection. It is better to have less that is prepared well than more that is substandard. The quality of most of the food was good. The potatoes and mac n cheese were very good. The take on chicken and waffles was interesting. The sausage and bacon - standard issue nothing special. The lobster benedict was okay. The cocktail shrimp and crab legs were good. There was also ham and lamb which I did not eat because I don't eat either. There were some 'luxury' selections like foie gras and caviar but I just don't like the taste of either so I passed on those. I did not understand the rice or pasta selection. Let me preface my service comments by saying that the omelet station was manned by a very nice young man and the omelet was good. I also had a conversation with, who I believe was the head chef. He was a nice man who took the time to speak with me briefly even though he was busy. I appreciated his time and gave him my thanks for working so hard on Easter. I would also like to say that water was filled consistently. My issues with this restaurant are as follows:- Wait staff - some not as good as expected. The restaurant was very busy because it was Easter and our waiter did not seem very attentive. I believe the waiter's assistant or 'valet' was annoyed because he was overworked. I asked for a cup of tea with honey and after a wait he came back and said he would try to find some. Okay - so as not to 'over work' him further I asked for sugar instead. He comes back with 4 packs of sugar substitute. I don't use that so I ask for 'real' sugar and I guess he had to go search for that as well. He came back with some very old looking sugar cubes. Okay. Then I had to ask for more hot water. We ordered two mimosas but were never asked if we wanted another round. I asked for a clean napkin - never got it. I felt like I was being a burden and the atmosphere at times felt 'hectic' and 'chaotic'. Disappointing for a 'Michelin' rated eatery.-A la carte buffet: All drinks expect tap water were extra. Okay so charge $110 instead of $95 and provide orange juice and coffee. Mimosa's $15 each and tea $7. Okay. Then if you want a few pasteries for the table add another $11. I really didn't want the carbs but come on. Let's keep it real. Give people a croissant and muffin and include that in the price. Dessert: one small piece of the desert of the day-no selection. Everything is extra. It's all about the dollars. - The check: I know that these types of eateries are expensive. I don't typically like 'fru fru' or uppidy places. I'm very down to earth but I do like well prepared food. With that said my spouse did not want me to see the bill and for good reason. In addition to the $95/pp, we had to pay for all drinks, the 21% automatically added gratuity, tax and get this 'health insurance."" In my lifetime I have never seen a restaurant charge for health insurance. If we are talking about a stellar staff okay, ask my permission first, then I'll pay. However, I want to pay for what I get. 21% off the top without getting feedback from the customer isn't fair. I always tip at least 20% if the service is good. On top of gratuity the restaurant owner wants us to pay for the staff's health insurance. I can do if everyone is friendly and doing their jobs but if they are acting like they don't want to be there, they are inattentive, or a bit arrogant then we have a problem. After seeing the bill all I could say was 'WOW"". That's bold. In summary I can't recommend this restaurant because for me I don't feel I got the 'experience' paid for. There was much lacking. We had to wait 15 minutes for our table and the car valet was no where to be found. Please research restaurants that require you to pay for your meal upfront because you will get charged even if you don't show or try to cancel. Also review their billing policy if available online. I don't recommend going on special occasions because the place gets crazy busy and you don't get the individual attention you'd expect.The staff spends more time with customers who buy additions, liquor, etc. The more you spend the more attention you get. I think that's sad because some people don't drink alcohol."

The food was excellent. Understand, I have never liked every dish prepared at this level (and my wife and I have enjoyed a dozen or more of this level of restaurant around the world), yet here as expected, each was explained, was unique, well thought out, intricately presented, fresh and enjoyable to experience. The best individual table experience we’ve experienced was in Bilbao at a three star, and the difference I can now clearly see. Regardless, the experience and service were exceptional. We were enabled extensive accommodations, taken to the kitchen, met the chef, took pictures and were treated absolutely wonderfully.

We went there to celebrate my husband's birthday. It started with the gracious welcome you expect from most highly regarded restaurants. The staff was incredibly nice and attentive, the service was impeccable. The atmosphere is beautiful, modern and inviting with elegance. We chose wine pairing with the tasting menu and everything was great ..but I have to say, for a two- star restaurant it was a little bit mediocre. We did not get the ""wow"" factor after any dish. While we enjoyed every course (Except for a cold mushroom soup), and it was better than an ordinary restaurant with a lot of creativity we decided it wasn’t our favorite choice among other Michelin starred restaurants.

Acadia,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g35805-d2511209-Reviews-Acadia-Chicago_Illinois.html,"December 11, 2018",2,Not what I expected from a 2-Michelin stared restaurant,"2 stars because I'm holding it to the standard of a Michelin 2 star restaurant. I would probably give it 3.5 stars if it didn't have any Michelin stars.To begin, we had a reservation for four for the tasting menu at 5pm on a Friday night. We arrived about 10 mins prior to our reservation only to find that the door was locked. We noticed a couple sitting at the bar inside and there was staff walking around but we were forced to wait outside in the bitter cold until 5:02 when the doors were opened. Prior to the beginning of service, our server confirmed that we had one individual in our party who had a gluten allergy. To a preference for no gluten, but a ""I will be in the bathroom all night if I eat gluten"" allergy. Then the amuse bouche comes out and lo-and-behold it's sitting on a fried pastry shell. We ask the server if this contains gluten to which they respond they don't know and will ask the kitchen. They return to say that there is only a small amount of gluten and ""you should be fine"". I felt that if this would have been a peanut allergy, it would be absolutely ludicrous for a chef to say ""there is only a tiny bit of peanut in there, you should be fine"", but that is the response we received. This process would repeat itself again when the petit fours were brought out and one consisted of a layered chocolate tort. We again asked if it contained gluten, the server returned to the kitchen to ask pastry and then come to inform us that pastry said there was only a tiny bit of flour and that it shouldn't be an issue.Our last service issue was when our second dessert course was brought out. It consisted of ice cream, with a white chocolate sphere, and what I believe was green matcha bread. The bread-free plate was served to me and not the individual who was actually allergic. I didn't notice until I was almost done with the dish and looked around to see the matcha bread on other peoples plates but not mine. The individual with the allergy received the plate with the bread. My wife and I have dined at a handful of Michelin stared restaurants to include Alinea, Per Se, Le Bernardin, Joel Robuchon, and Boca. All in all, it was just not service that one would expect from a Michelin starred restaurant. We are not pretentious when it comes to fine dining and I have never actually complained to a restaurant because I don't think I am qualified to critique a chef, but if there was ever a time when I wanted to more than ever it was during this dining experience. As for the food, it was very underwhelming with one dish barely palatable. The standouts for me were the lobster in the Tom Kha inspired sauce (I'm a huge Thai food fan so me enjoying this was surely a given) although it's presentation left a little to be desired. The other was the main dessert course discussed above. The pasta dish with white truffle and bonito flakes was insanely over-seasoned. The truffle was not fresh and provided no savoriness to the dish, and the dish was extremely over-salted to the point that it was inedible and I like salt. Often in my cooking my wife claims that I over-salt my dishes but this dish was on another level. Lastly the Wagyu supplement for $65 was not only a waste of money but was a terribly composed dish of what is otherwise a great cut of protein. The beef was literally served between two pieces of grilled white bread accompanied by some mayo and greens with a lemon. I lost a little faith in Michelin that night as a reliable restaurant reviewer. Had this restaurant not had any stars and was a quarter of of the price I would have chocked it up to be an off night with a new kitchen possibly rolling out a new menu. However, when a restaurant has two stars and you are paying what you do, you expect to have a level of service and food that is commiserate with their Michelin rating and for Acadia, they just did not deliver."

Mission accomplished. After only 10 months, McCaskey's Acadia was awarded its first Michelin star. In 2015, it claimed two Michelin stars. In 2012, it received the Jean Banchet Best Restaurant Award. In 2016, it earned five stars from Chicago Tribune restaurant critic Phil Vettel. It also has received a AAA Five-Diamond Award. What's next? Three Michelin stars? Located at 1639 South Wabash Avenue in Chicago, Acadia is an upscale, posh restaurant serving North American dishes inspired by McCaskey's boyhood home, coastal Maine, specifically Penobscot Bay. It is open from 5:30 to 9 on Wednesday and Thursday, from 5 to 11 on Friday and Saturday and from 5 to 9 on Sunday. Like many Michelin-caliber restaurants, Acadia offers an eight-course tasting menu. It is a growing practice that my wife and I became acquainted with at Patrick O'Connell's Inn at Little Washington in Virginia. As O'Connell explained, it affords the chef an opportunity to explore and experiment with many different dishes, not just a few. McCaskey's menu included a Hudson Canyon scallop, fire-roasted cabbage, a Stonington lobster, Chinese duck, pappardelle with truffle parmesan, whole wheat sourdough, Elysian Fields lamb and lime panna cotta with apple gel, match cake and apple ice cream. For $165 per person, in an intimate and romantic setting, you can't beat a fine dining experience at Acadia."

Don't be fooled by the unassuming frontage of this nondescript location. The experience within is superb, from arrival to departure. Our group was not looking for the full gastronomic experience that can be had with one of the tasting menus, after all it was Halloween, so we opted to be seated in the bar area. Our server, Nicole, was immediately attentive, cordial, and clearly there to curate our dinner. After beverage service, she returned to take our order. She was one of those uncanny servers who could tell the absolute most appropriate time to appear and disappear. I ordered a salad and a burger, but what I received was something akin to paradise. The salad was artfully constructed in a manner reminiscent of an architectural drawing with the appropriate precision. More impressive than the presentation was the delicate blending of subtle flavors, rarely found in a dish as light. The burger was anything but what the name might suggest. It was as good as any aged ribeye I have had in a fine steakhouse, and it was adorned in a complex array of flavors that left the palate in a state of wonder. If I had any criticism, and it can't really be one when ordering a burger, it was a little too rich. My fellow diners had the short ribs, lobster roll (well, it is named Acadia), fries and a small treat. Perhaps the most impressive moment of the entire evening was when Chef Ryan came out to our table to check on our meal. He was the most cordial and convivial culinarian I have ever met. I can't wait to go back and try the full dining experience. It must be unbelievable."

You won’t hate the food but won’t love it either. Not worth the price tag and gives Michelin a bad name. Plus the service is not great. I usually love most restaurants, from French laundry and Gary dankos to chains like the Cheesecake Factory and random burger joints. I was excited to take my wife to a Michelin star restaurant during our weekend in Chicago. I called for reservations but they were booked, however we were told we could sit in the bar area and order everything from the main room. So we headed out on an hour ride there and arrived hungry and ready to try everything. Upon getting there we realized the restaurant was empty. There was only one other couple and a random single guy at the bar. Most of the people were staff. (A place that isn’t packed is a red flag but it has a Michelin star so we figure it should still be awesome). When we tried to order we were informed we could not order the large multi course menu, only a la carte. I explained to the waiter that we were told otherwise over the phone. He went to check with the chef to see if he could accommodate us but it was too much trouble, they would not. So we ordered a lot of items a la carte. The drinks were pretty but too sweet and not Michelin pretty. We ordered based on the waiters recommendations and the food was just okay. The portions were fine but the food wasn’t Michelin quality either. They used expensive ingredients like lobster and lots of truffle oil but they didn’t put them together in a Michelin quality way. Everything was just okay and disappointing. The staff raved about a burger that was the best in Chicago but ended up being somewhat insipid. The lobster roll was good but nothing I couldn’t order from a food truck. Presentation was not good. It was just all around not a great experience. The food was on par with the Cheesecake Factory, maybe slightly below, and the service definitely subpar. Maybe their head chef had the night off, I hope the owner reads this and fires the manager or chef who was there Oct 27, for the sake of his business. Anyway we ended up going to the theatre to see Hamilton and stopped by a random place next door to it with some old world charm. We ordered some food there and it was absolutely awesome. Maybe Acadia set the bar so low that anything would have impressed us by that time. If you’ve never been Michelin please don’t come to Acadia, you’re going to throw away your money. There have got to be better Michelin star restaurants in Chicago that will give you an out of body experience. I wish Acadia was one of them but unfortunately they will disappoint."

We are in Chicago fairly often, and I try to stay current on restaurants in the City. Over the years, some of our favorites have been Alinea, Everest, Charlie Trotter, Next and now Acadia. They had not made my “radar screen,” but the Concierge at the Fairmont Millennium Park recommended them highly, and I found him to be quite the “foodie,” though I rather dislike that term. Here, it fit. They also had been awarded 2 Michelin stars, and I normally keep a close watch on such. This reiterated how useful a good Concierge can be.We arrived for our reservation, and were promptly seated. We started with some Champagne, The Taittinger La Francais Brut, and the Pierre Paillard ""Les Tres Roses"" Grand Cru Extra Brut Rosé, while we looked over the Seven-Course Tasting Menu.We elected to go with the wine pairings, and were glad that we did. While I know my way around a wine list, and while Acadia had a lot to offer, I did not know the chef, or the kitchen, and sometimes that knowledge can significantly impact the chosen wines.Our decision made, we just sat back, and had a glorious night.Our Tasting Menu consisted of:Parmesan Thyme Cookie w/ truffled Bavarian puffed beef tendon and ramen packetGournay cheese, pâté à chouxCod brandade and Cheddar saltine – these were served on cross-sectioned logs, with the crackers in a beautifully folded napkin. An outstanding starter, and visually arresting too!Seeded Beer Bread w/ Animal Farm Butter – though not from an extravagant bread cart, like say Jöel Robuchon, I do not think I could have made a better selection, and I love breads.Asparagus w/ rhubarb, brioche and Osetra caviar – an exquisite dish, and I am not a big asparagus fan. We were certainly off to a great start.“Chicken Salad” w/ liver mousse, “Miners” lettuce and mustards – the kitchen was on a role, and we had another winner.“Ravioli” w/ pastura con trufa raviolo, ram, morels and sauce Normande – note here, that some of the course titles are in quotes. Those come from the menu, and also signify that the dish is a deviation, or maybe even a departure, from what one might normally expect, from just the title. In each case, the deviation, or departure worked beautifully.Spanish Octopus w/ piri piri, olive and Anson Mills cream peas – possibly the best octopus that I have had, with an excellent texture. I know Anson Mills, (I was in the room, when Glenn Roberts received an achievement award from Southern Foodways Alliance, at Blackberry Farm, for his “heirloom products”), but was unfamiliar with their Cream Peas. Just a spectacular dish.Yukon Potato “Risotto” w/ leek fines herbes and black truffle – another quotation, and another departure, but a very successful one.Potato Bread w/ dill, allium butter – but I was not done with my Seeded Beer Bread! OK, time to let that go, and try the Potato Bread. Though not from a bread cart, someone was doing a great job with both these breads, and the butters. Keep it up guys, you have hit, after hit going.A5 Miyazaki Beef w/ hon shimeji, miso potato purée and furikake – The beef was excellent. It, alone, should have 3 Michelin stars! The prep was interesting, and complimentary.Foie Gras Gateau w/ strawberry, pistachio, rhubarb and fennel – I am a big fan of Foie Gras, but it was lost in the Gateau (rice cake), but then the other ingredients stepped up, so it was not really missed.Papaya w/ honey milk and Yuzu tapioca – OK, I am much more of a Cheese Course guy, and usually share that with my wife, getting only a taste of her dessert. However, this dessert might just change my habits.We finished with “Variations of Chocolate” in an array, Dark, Milk, Caramelized White, Beet and Mint – here, the quotation marks are my own. This was a fun course, and whoever heard of “Beet Chocolate?” I had not, before this night, but now have something to look for.The wines were:Cantina Adriano Gewürztraminer, Alto Adige ‘15Azienda Agricola Barone Cornacchia Pecorino Controguerra. Abruzzo ‘15Domaine DuBois Bernard & Fils Aligoté (the “lost grape” of Burgundy, and one of the best examples of that varietal, that I have ever had) ‘14Château Puech-Hout Rosè “Prestige” ‘17 from the LanguedocWinzerhof Stahl “Edel” Chardonnay Franken ‘15Emmanuel Darnaud “Mis en Bouche” Crozes-Hermitage ‘16Emilio Bulfon Moscato Rosa Friuli ‘14Marenco Brachetto D’Acqui “Pineto” Piedmont ‘16And I had added the two Champagnes, at the start of the evening.We kept many of our wine glasses, for several courses. Not to test the Sommelier, but to have the opportunity to taste each dish, with several wines. Our spacious table accommodated all beautifully, and after asking if the Champagne glasses could be removed, to which I replied “No, not yet,” the glasses were completely untouched, until completely empty, and moved to the side of the table.Service was impeccable, as was the pacing. Nothing was rushed, and there were no noticeable pauses. While the waitstaff was always about, they basically went unnoticed, until a new course was being brought out. It was perfect, and worthy of that third star.The venue is interesting, in that it is a bit of “industrial modern,” but then with several Asian elements. Our table was very comfortable, and all around us were well-spaced, allowing very easy access to the servers. The lighting was very good, and I prefer good lighting over a table, as seeing a presentation is highly important to me.For the overall experience, it was more like the late Grace, but with a bit of Atelier Crenn (San Francisco) for the presentations. They were not as dramatic, or as interactive, as say Alinea, a restaurant experience, which we greatly enjoyed – much more subtle.Since we have fairly recently dined at many Michelin-starred restaurants, Alinea, Grace, Quince, Pétrus, Galvin @ Windows, Campton Place, La Bernardine, Restaurant Daniel and the Minibar by José Andrés (plus his É in Las Vegas), and then Jöel Robuchon and Guy Savoy in Las Vegas, I can honestly say that Acadia is one of the best dining experiences we have had. They are THAT good.The portion sizes are adequately small, but then there are seven, plus two bread courses, so we did not leave hungry. The wine pairings were excellent, for the dishes, and while not the highest-end we have experienced, perfect for this evening.If I had only one complaint, it would be that my beloved “travel camera” was malfunctioning, so that many of the dishes will not be depicted. That has been fixed by the Canon repair staff.As a PS, I collect menus and wine lists from many restaurants. They function as notes for my reviews, and as mementos of dining experiences. The menus from Acadia were fantastic, beautifully presented in a folder, with a sting, and a seal. Recently, at a Michelin 2-star restaurant in London, I was told “we do not provide menus, or wine lists to guests.” They proposed sending me an e-mail, with all details, but in 15 mos, that has not arrived. Acadia had no such problems, and were proud to provide ALL details, for a wonderful evening. I hope that I thanked the Fairmont Concierge enough for this reservation."

Hosts are friendly and very knowledgeable about both the food and wine. We were sat at a table which had what initially looked like a woodsy centerpiece of branches and moss. But then you realize you initial bites are on the branches. From there on the service is done in concert by the servers and each plate is delivered and removed together with a detailed description of the courses. All dishes were paired with uniquely selected wines. Every one was just enough to enjoy the flavor profile, but not overfilling. A wonderful experience that left us sated and relaxed."
Acadia,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g35805-d2511209-Reviews-Acadia-Chicago_Illinois.html,"March 3, 2018",5,Excellent across the board,"We have been fortunate to have dined at multiple Michelin starred restaurants - but Acadia stands out.This isn’t 'a French restaurant plonked down in Chicago' - it excels in its own unique ways.There aren't too many choices to make when you arrive. The first is whether to have a drink in the bar first. Our recommendation is definitely yes - and order a 'carte blanche' cocktail: you choose your core spirit, and the barman creates his own cocktail around it. One of us chose gin, the other rum, and we were both delighted with what we received.The menu, since January 2018, is a 7 course tasting menu, with an option to add an additional course before dessert. In addition, a couple of the courses require you to choose between two or three different options. All in all, this isn’t hard to get your head around.The final question is whether to go for the 'wine pairing', or choose other drinking options. We chose the former, to give the restaurant free rein.Every one of our courses was excellent. More importantly, every course was unusual. To give one example: if you had offered me a dish focused on a scallop, white chocolate and grapefruit, I would have laughed. But in practice it was superb. As a second example, we were surprised to have a fiery, spicy course at the mid-point of the meal - but again it worked superbly and didn’t detract from the succeeding courses.And the wine pairings (which in our case were primarily Italian with a couple of French selections thrown in) were excellent choices in each case.So a clear 5 star review from us.That said, there is always room for improvement. To reach even greater heights, we would humbly suggest Acadia look at the following:1. The room. It’s just not exciting - though it is less impersonal in reality than its photographs suggest. P2. The allocation of servers to tables. Halfway through our meal, the gentleman who had introduced every wine and food course up to that point disappeared, and someone else appeared in his stead. The reason was that issues elsewhere meant that the team swapped servers rather than keep us waiting. But, having built a rapport with 'our' server, it was disconcerting that he suddenly disappeared. We would rather have waited a while and maintained continuity.3. Approach to tipping. We were given the bill, and were told it was 'all in'. It was clear that 21% service / tip had been added, and we had no issue with that. But when our card was run, I was invited to add an 'optional additional tip'. This just seemed weird. Please either leave the tip to me, or suggest what I should pay - but please don’t suggest what I should pay and then ask for more afterwards.But these three points are minor quibbles.Overall, this was a wonderful experience, and we will definitely return."

The difference is stark in terms of atmosphere , taste and experience. Each will suit some types of people but I don't think each type would enjoy the other. If you like one of them you are unlikely by nature to like the other.So I think you can guess Acadia is not going to come out well on this one. However on the positives there is a clear sense of occasion and the food is very pretty and ""Michelin"" looking. The dining room is a cool space and the waiters all look very smart and are very attentive. i caught a glimpse of the kitchen on the way in and saw a chef with tweezers doing something to a plate of food , this was a clue as to what was to follow...It pains me to write a negative review when I can just partially appreciate the incredible amount of man hours and skill that must go into producing the picture perfect dishes that emerge from the kitchen . We had the seven course tasting menu and stunning looking dish after the other were put before us. However there were two key elements missing. Taste and warmth (on the dishes that needed to be warm). The crab dish , oh my goodness is looked like a Picasso from the art museum . However it did not really taste of anything , it was frankly insipid . The Cauliflower that had been cooked sous vide with foam and all sorts of fancy bits was stone cold. Cold veg is not an easy one. The Duck dish again was beautiful looking but stone cold. The Poached lobster was over cooked and not deveined, I would not care that much but with the aspirations of this restaurant and the prices I do care.I am sorry , it was not worth the money or the time for me. Lots of people were there and seemed to be genuinely enjoying the experience . As I started by saying , it would provide a sense of occasion for a special treat however it was not for me. I loved Smyth , please see my review , and I suspect the people enjoying Acadia would not ."

And I understand it is not main stream and it can be expensive. I have been privileged to dine many times at Tru, Alinea and Oriole among other stellar restaurants in the Chicago area and have always come away with some very fond memories.As you anticipate I am about to eviscerate Acadia.But before I do, in all fairness I did a a little research online and those pictures and food/service descriptions do credit to their establishment and prop up their 2 star Michelin rating.But dear God our meal tonight was just awful.Even though up front we had purchased tickets (included a 9 course meal and wine pairing for 3 - over $1K) our host started off by trying to up sell us with a wagyu beef dish and cocktails. We declined.And so the ordeal began. Plate after plate showed up beautifully presented (but not quite as beautiful as the pix on line). And I do believe that a lot of hours had gone into the preparations but somehow the all the flavor had been worried out of it in the kitchen. Tasteless is the one word that I will associate with this meal forever.The Amuse Bouches which should just have wowed us seemed tired at best. Many courses were presented with the poor servers having to add meaningless drops of sauce at the table which could easily have been done in the kitchen. Bread seemed to be a big deal (it comprised a couple of courses) but it was adequate at best and there were some muffin biscuit ""rocks"" that we were served at one point which would have caused the entire kitchen to be sent home from Top Chef. Proteins were pretty awful - pork cheeks had no flavor (honest I made a better prep at home last week) and the lobster tail was very tough - sadly have had much better on cruise ships. And the pork ""Cracklin"" was anything but - it could have been used for a Space Shuttle tile.Also the wine pairing was kind of insulting. Most of it did not match the food except by accident. Yes it was exotic but I felt like I was being duped into paying high prices for international wines that I could not pronounce or find on line easily but most of which were probably pretty inexpensive. And the icing on the cake was that coffee/tea service was an extra charge.Maybe the chef is on holiday - but don't go any time soon..."

The stark modern decoration keeps your focus on the food and service but is not comfortable or inviting. We did the five course tasting menu with wine pairing. The food was artfully presented and service well-timed and coordinated, but the food fell short in 2 of the 5 servings.

From the outside, everything looked promising: small sorta non conspicuous entry, hot developing area on the south loop, and the Michelin Star. The restaurant itself was nice and cozy, and a relief from the frigid cold. I ordered the lobster Benedict, and was pleasantly surprised by the chef's complimentary pastry plate, and thought ok so far. Then my dish came out, and the muffin was stale and cold, as well as the dish was mostly luke warm. I ate some of it but sent it back to get it reheated. Even with the reheat, the flavor was a bit on the bland side and the lobster was overdone. I don't plan on going back. Maybe other menus are good but it is not somewhere where I had a great first impression. "

But I thought Acadia was an upscale, high-brow restaurant that emphasized Chinese duck, pig heart tartare, Hudson Valley foie gras and Tasmanian ocean trout, not hamburgers. But a visit to Acadia, which is located at 1639 South Wabash on Chicago's South Side, reveals that it is much more than that. Hamburger joints don't rate two stars by Michelin. As such, Acadia is one of the top five restaurants in the Chicago area. It also offers a tasting menu, a sampling of a lot of tasty items that is becoming very popular at quality restaurants across the country. Another exceptional feature of chef/owner Ryan McCaskey's restaurant is the impeccable service and the presentation of each course. Do you want to know the story behind Golden Thai snapper or Indiana duck or Maine seafood Tom Kha? They'll tell you. This isn't a place for traditional food. No shrimp cocktail or Caesar salad. It's an enjoyable dining experience for discriminating diners who want to sample different a host of fresh and innovative and delicious culinary creations that you won't find anywhere else. I was especially impressed with the Tiger shrimp and Tasmanian ocean trout. I was reluctant to order lobster because it is too rich for my blood, like crab cakes, but my wife was persuaded to give it a try. She wasn't disappointed. There isn't anything more fresh than Maine lobster. Acadia knows how to prepare it as if the restaurant was located in Gloucester. But I'll stick with shrimp and trout and a chocolate/lemon dessert. And the hamburger. With two Michelin stars on the front door, they must be doing something right."

You enter into a sophisticated small bar area with all the latest Japanese liquors and few of the typical name brands. I thought ""uh-oh"" this place might be too foo-foo for me, and I was right. The bartender was less than friendly and we opted not to order drinks. Our wait wasn't long and we were led into a nice size dining room where simplicity reigns with no table cloths and little on the tables. Clearly the restaurant has an Asian theme and there were many servers in attendance, but the wait to get some food was way too long. Water came quickly and nothing else for 10-15 minutes. No bread, no nothing.And then we began our 5 course tasting menu. I've found that tasting sometimes means you'll leave the restaurant hungry and that sure was the case.The truffle cookie was good, as were 2 of the 3 others in a box. The lobster roll was tasty but truly bite size, the cured tuna was bursting with flavor and my taste buds were loving it; but the olive bon bon was absolutely terrible and spoiled everything. Yuck! Don't know who thought that was a good idea. The cavier, potato soup was in the smallest thumbnail bowl possible but delectable. I was getting worried because the portions were so small. The Thai peanut soup was ok but the lobster was underwhelming and the pheasant ravioli was terrible. I purchased the Miyazaki beef for an additional $75 and it was good, but for $75 it was terribly overpriced. The little stories the servers told you about the chef inspired dishes was interesting, but without more food was an exercise in futility. The chocolate and deserts were adequate, but for a restaurant that clearly is catering to an upscale crowd, it was a big miss for me. Much too long a dining experience and overly expensive considering we left hungry."

We ate at another restaurant the night before and were blown away by that. I have to admit, I was upset about the whole lead up. We had reservations nearly a month in advance for Sunday for a birthday celebration. A week before they called and said they were suddenly closed for maintenance. How was that not anticipated? Strange how that happened considering they require you to purchase tickets in advance. Katelynn went to a lot of effort to reschedule with another restaurant and fit us in for Saturday but it was an inconvenience given we had guests flying in from out of town. No other accommodations were offered for the inconvenience other than we could cancel. HmmmmIn total we added 5 drinks to the tickets, one more wine pairing and a Wagyu beef dish that somehow added $250 to the prepaid bill.Now on to the food and service..the melon dish was bland and unimaginative. Molecular gastronomy and agar are passé unless the flavor was intense or unusual because T this was boring. The Wagyu beef was warm and not hot and we had 4 to share ( they said that was ok) but there were only 3 small pieces for $85.But thank god we ordered it for our 5 course meal because that was insufficient but due to our late seating were not able to order the largerTasting menu (in hindsight, glad we didn't). They were not even aware of which tasting menu we ordered and asked us despite ordering this well in advance. Poor communication. Water glasses were not filled through the evening. While you might expect this at a lower caliber restaurant, we found this surprising. The lobster roll was good but not exotic or innovative. The chicken was tepid and had an unusual consistency. The cucumber frozen dessert/intermezzo pictured below was novel but I have to say that I can't remember because they never offered us a menu as a souvenir as is so typical of restaurants of this caliber. Cardamaro was one of the wine pairing offerings and actually delicious but at a cost of about $15 a bottle, not something you would expect from a 2 star Michelin restaurant with an $85 wine pairing. On top of all that, it was a birthday celebration with nothing special to truly mark the occasion. I feel I'm being generous in giving 4 stars but not interested in ever returning. "

How this place ended up with two Michelin stars is beyond me.I have visited a multitude of Michelin starred restaurants around the world and this is by far the worst. The restaurant itself is quite bland in appearance. The service was just OK, but given you are required to pay a 23 PERCENT GRATUITY IN ADVANCE one might expect more. 23 percent. In advance. That's pretty aggressive by anyone's standards. The food was nicely plated and good, not great. Certainly not two-star worthy. But where Acadia truly failed is in the wine pairing. The shortest pours I've ever seen. I'm not looking to get smashed at one of these, but for $85 you got little more than a glass of wine (five pours). The wines themselves were good, I really wish I could have enjoyed them. To top it off, the somm had a jacket full of smudges and stains. At a two-star restaurant, you really need to have your somm in a decent looking jacket, don't you think?Acadia just picked up its second Michelin star this year. Not sure how on earth that could have happened, but I think it's going to put a lot of undue pressure on this place. Expectations are going to be very high. And Acadia will not live up to them.

However, it was not as smooth or faultless or as well-choreographed as, let's say, Grace. A bit rough for a 2 Michelin-star restaurant actually. Perhaps, they should hire the folks who trained the staff at Grace to give them a seminar or two. To be billed a 23% service charge beforehand (as the reservation had to be 'bought' and fully paid for prior to the visit),I would expect a service that's impeccable and definitely way above what I experienced.Am I going back?

Service was friendly if unpolished. At times we saw the waiters make 'false starts' as one let his station slightly before the other as they attempted to synchronise their table movements. The food was passable but not up to par and in short supply for our liking. Perhaps this was an off night.

I would say ""as expected"" but that is always not really fair compared to the high standard that is delivered here.We had 4 different ""greetings from the chef"", all in excellent quality and taste.

Even though we paid 175$ for the large tasting menu and another 125$ for the wine pairing I would truly say: its worth it.Go there if you are up for a really good Michelin star restaurant and have time for a special dinner event.Don't go there if you simply wanna get a dinner and be saturated 60min later, that´s not worth it and is also disrespectful for the people that work really hard in order to make this restaurant and its food a special one."

They also served us 3 ""pre-appetizers"", a pre-dessert and little cookies after; so our total was 10 different dishes.As noted in other reviews, the portions a very small. However, the intensity of the flavors and the exquisite platings (this is the first time we photographed our plates at a restaurant) more than compensate. The wine pairings were well-chosen and described. The pours were only a couple ounces; so despite drinking six different wines we were in no way impaired (or over-full) when we left to drive home.The service was exceptionally competent. Even though one of our servers was on his first day he was clearly a well trained part of the team.The negatives: although safe, this location is several blocks south of the trendy South Loop restaurants.

Having eaten at a number of Michelin star restaurants around the world, it's always great to try new places that Michelin has determined is upping its game.Acadia did not disappoint. Having the 10 course tasting menu (which included a number of pre, mid, and post dishes not included in that count) was a good experience. A small number of dishes were just exquisite; most dishes were very good; and a small number really missed the mark (the asparagus and the lamb tenderloin). Most of the wine pairings were done well, but there were a couple of misses. When the sommelier explains that people either love or hate the Chinato--maybe it's not the best choice for a forced, matched pairing. They did comp me a glass of port--which worked much better with the dish--but, things just need some small tweaks.The only real downside to the evening was the service. It was certainly not bad--it just wasn't up to the high standard that I would expect for restaurants of this caliber. There were a number of mis-queues where a dish came before a wine pairing; a waiter came and removed a glass that someone had just set for the next pairing (twice); and folks just seemed new (maybe 50% of the staff). Every restaurant has to train its staff, but the polish on all of the service was not there--and it showed and ended up detracting from what would have been a great experience.With all of that said, Acadia is still definitely deserving of a rating of 5 on TripAdvisor and 1 Michelin star. The chef still is experimenting with and refining new dishes; not all of them will hit the mark, but a stagnant chef is far worse. Refinement of the service should continue to evolve, but it's something that will have to be watched. If you're looking for a fine dining experience in Chicago, do check out Acadia. You'll enjoy the food."

Since this place as gotten 2 stars in the michelin guide, we thought this would be an exciting place.This restaurant may deserve a bib gourmand, but no stars. The place was very noisy as there was no door between the dining area and the kitchen. The interior was cold. The waiters were very professional, and the sommelier was the main attraction of the evening.We had a 10 course tasting menu with wine pairing. I've had similar in several one and two star michelin restaurants. I was disappointed. The food in it self was very good, the wines were paired good, and the sommelier told us many interesting facts about the wines. However the courses were so small that we never really felt like we had been eating, they were no larger than a carnappe in other restaurants, the wine were in matched size. The fancy stuff they usually do with some courses in such restaurants basically lacked. It felt like we were stressed trough the set, as they were rushing food and plates in and out of our table. All in all a good meal, especially the main course and the dessert was amazing. However; even for a tasting menu, way to small courses. Price was stiff, probably worth 2/3 of what we paid."

At a restaurant of this caliber, there should never be a need for me to be turned around in my seat looking for someone….ANYone….to come attend to our table. That being said…if you are a burger fan, it is still worth a stop here to try the Acadia Burger. Excellent meat and unique condiments, perfectly topped with Gruyère cheese. And although there are only about 10 accompanying French fries, they are perfect little golden nubbins of crispiness."

Our server was knowledgeable, friendly, not pretentious and patient with our questions. The wine parings went very well with all course but maybe one.

All of the flavors of each grouping were distinct, even in the ""bites"" of pig heart tartare and trout roe. The wine pairings were perfect.

However, they seated us without much fuss. The waitress introduced herself, asked about allergies saying none were marked on the reservation. There were four of us; one did not eat meat but did eat fish and seafood. She assured us that that would be no problem and it was not. She brought us a wine list. We asked for a cocktail menu since a friend had told us the bartender was very thoughtful and inventive. The menu was short but had fascinating and unusual drink preparations. After ordering our drinks, the waitress brought us the dinner menu. There were two tasting menus, one on each side. The left, $95, was five courses. The right, $165, was for twelve courses. We chose the shorter menu but with all the little extras (three amuses bouches before the first course), bread, an extra dessert and sweets afterwards, it came to at least eleven courses! The tables, decor and food presentation were restrained but elegant, tasteful. It was quiet enough for conversation even when the restaurant was full. The food was very good, some dishes even great. The service was efficient and understated. We were presented with menus and tiny muffins as we left. The restaurant is in a bit of an iffy neighborhood, unmarked, but comfortable safe."

Acadia is my first 2-star restaurant and it did not disappoint. My SO and I opted for the 5 course chef's seasonal tasting menu with wine pairing and it was absolutely outstanding. The courses went from lighter to heavier as did the wines and we both really enjoyed each course. The menu was very unique with a good combination of traditional methods and more modern molecular gastronomy themes (and heavy on lobster which I appreciated). The service was outstanding as would be expected from a 2 Michelin Star Restaurant, but it was not as starched or ""up tight"" as some others in its class (e.g. Tru). Apparently Chef McCaskey's philosophy and mission with Acadia is to bring Michelin Guide-quality food and experience to the masses, and quite frankly, from a cost perspective, there's no question he has achieved that with Acadia. With the tasting menu and wine pairing and a cocktail to start, it was still an incredibly reasonably priced meal (considering the quality and reputation). I highly recommend, and so far, Acadia has earned its spot as one of the best restaurants in Chicago, and perhaps the best value of a Michelin starred (or two-starred) restaurant I've ever been to."

Our service last time was like a dance, constantly keeping an eye on everything and when each person finished their courses. This time however, the wait between courses was ridiculous, the servers seemed to struggle stating the menu descriptions and more than once I had to ask for a napkin or extra silverware. The food while impressive to look at, was just so-so. I appreciate the level of culinary artistry here, but the food still has to taste good and in most cases, the food along with the wine pairings felt disjointed and mis-matched. I will also add that the price of our meal was astounding for what we received. I would never pay that much again to receive the service and meal that we did. Acadia by FAR has been my favorite restaurant in Chicago but now I am not sure I would return."

My girlfriend won't eat the burger after her gristly experience with them in the past, so she ordered wings, which were just alright.I ordered the shroom burger and requested a pretzel bun instead of the one it came with and cooked to medium rare. I ordered carry-out and was told it would be 20 minutes. I arrived right on time and was greeted by the person at the register. He was not very friendly and collected my money. He never said anything like it would be ready soon. About 12 minutes later when someone who arrived after me picked up their order, I asked when mine would be ready since it should have been done 15 minutes ago. I was finally told it would be ready soon. The person preparing the orders after they were cooked looked completely overwhelmed. Nobody there seems to be able to do more than one thing at a time. That's why they are notorious for taking forever even though it wasn't crowded.So here's the results: Wrong bun and cooked to medium well. Completely tasteless along with being way over-priced. Thank God my girlfriend didn't order a burger. It was full of gristle from my first bite to my last. And they brag about grinding fresh everyday and the quality of meat they use?I don't eat White Castle, but I'm willing to bet their burgers are better. This has to be one of the worst burgers in the city. Actually, I can't imagine anyplace being worse.In conclusion, if you want to eat a horrible, overpriced, tasteless burger that is over-cooked along with messing up the order and waiting forever for it--this is your place.As for anyone giving this place great reviews, they are either friends and family of the owners, or their taste is as bad as the burgers."

One thing we learned is Harold's Chicken Shack is a Chicago original. Harold Pierce, an African-American entrepreneur, and his wife...Hilda founded the restaurant in 1950 as a small operation on 39th Street on Chicago's South Side. It was called H&H in those early days and specialized in dumplings and chicken feet, both common soul food. Eventually, it became one of the few examples of a thriving fast food chain that was owned by and principally served the black community. Today, Harold's has more than 40 locations in Chicago and vicinity, including the flagship at 124 East 35th Street. We sampled the chicken and takeout service at 612 South Wabash and 1501 West Madison in the West Loop, near United Center. In case you haven't compared Harold's chicken to KFC or Popeye's or Brown's Chicken, Harold's is different in two ways--(1) it is cooked in a mix of half beef tallow and half vegetable oil, which provides taste closer to the traditional fried chicken of the American South, while most chains use only vegetable oil and (2) Harold's chicken isn't fried until it is ordered while some chains fry their chicken in large batches and store it on warming racks until it is purchased. I ordered a 1/2 white chicken dinner, two wings and two breasts with fries, cole slaw and bread. My wife opted for an eight-piece chicken tender dinner with fries, cole slaw and bread.More"

One of the all-time fried chicken greats.,"I went to #71 near McCormick Place (the convention center). A small, VERY unassuming walk-up store. Take out only at this location. Be prepared to wait a while  as the chicken is essentially fried to order. Always has been; always will be. So, just the...OPPOSITE of fast food chicken. WELL worth the wait. Be prepared to be elbow to elbow with all manner of customer, especially hard working folks before or after their shifts. This, in my opinion, is a good thing. The basic meal comes with chicken on a slice of white bread, fries, and a very small portion cup of cole slaw. I get mine with Harold's hot sauce; it's not too hot and it's very tasty. And the fried chicken is just like older guys like me remember it. Small pieces (no chicken on steroids!); tender; tasty. Very inexpensive. Years ago fried chicken stopped tasting like fried chicken to me. But not at Harold's. Fried chicken like I remember it. That's a good thing.More"

They must have danced for about 10 seconds before just walking around for the remainder of the song asking for cash...tips.  It feels like it is more about the money than providing the audience an actual show. I truly felt taken advantage of as there was no performance  Also, they tell you it’s $45.99 per person and it was very disappointing because they continuously keep trying to get you to buy “special shots” during the show while asking for cash tips. Then they provide themselves a 20% gratuity once you get your receipt at the end of the night.  There also was a lack of professionalism from the staff, I had another reservation with friends for another day so I called to cancel and they asked how I enjoyed the previous performance as they saw my name on the reservation from the night before. I told them how I honestly felt about the performance and in no rude way. They hung up on me.  This all bothered me way more than the poor quality food provided as my expectations for food were not high, so I was not disappointed there. It met my expectations of mediocre dry food. Which I didn’t even mention to them.  I’d go to another drag show elsewhere to enjoy an actual performance. This does not allow them to show their talents which is very unfortunate because I’m sure they have a lot of it.More"

Food was fantastic, and the show was excellent, even with the Covid Protocols in place.  We felt everything was cleaned well and people were spaced in a way that no one came in close contact.

I figured it would fill my belly, but be tough and flavorless - BOY WAS I WRONG, but I get ahead of myself.  We took the Green Line to the...show (too cheap to Uber); just a short walk to the theater. Yes I did it in heels . . . not easy but accomplished.  We had booked the late seating. Lovely Tori greeted us  (party of two) and sat us right next to the stage. We were going to have a view!   A lovely queen came to take our drink order and explain how to find the digital menu. It was very hard to hear her with the background music playing and her clear chin face mask. Those drink were delivered. We opted for the Frozen Cosmo and were not disappointed - they were pleasantly strong. My partner was a bit chilled and inquired about a warm drink. Coffee was available and they added a shot of Bailey's. It did the trick.  We watched as others arrived. A very large bachelorette party was in the center of the room, and then a smattering of other tables due to COVID restrictions. All of the servers were masked. The showplace was beautifully appointed. It was over the top but not garish. Funky yet classy. A perfect setting for the queens to do their thing.  Our permanent waitress then came to take our order. She wanted to get it in prior to the large party. We appreciated her thoughtfulness. A food runner brought out our caesar salads which were dressed perfectly and not swimming in dressing. And then the meals arrived. I had the rigatoni in vodka sauce and my partner the grilled chicken breast. I was truly blown away by the flavor and presentation of the food. But the tenderness of the chicken both in my pasta and that of my parter's meal was astounding. The only slight disappointment was that the menu said we would get a dessert but one never arrived.   The show was everything I had hoped for and more. This was my first drag show. I had seen Trixie Mattel in a solo show and I have seen Les Ballets Trockadero, but not a traditional show. I appreciated the stage hostess saying something about tipping the performers because I was not aware that was a thing and did not come prepared. Our food runner graciously broke some $20s for us. The 'singing' was spot on. The dancing shook all the right things. The energy remained high for the night. $5 shots with a sparkly ring were offered midway and of course we needed those!  After the show Tori spoke to my partner and I for about 15 minutes about her experience and answering the questions my partner and I had. We really appreciated the time she took with us. Before leaving we checked out the restrooms - which were upstairs . . . ugh - drunk test. I told you the drinks were good!! The upstairs had high top tables for when they were at full capacity. The bathrooms were lovely.   I can't wait to return. I look forward to attending the Gospel Brunch.More"

As soon as we entered we were excited because the decor and all the ladies were fabulous. The service at the bar was great as were the drinks. When we were seated I noticed my sister whispering about something turns out she was confirming the birthday package. As soon as our server approached the table she said do you know what you want to eat. It was a bit abrupt since we had about 30 seconds to review the menu. We asked for suggestions and she replied that she had only tried two of the options. My sister once again started whispering. The salads arrived quickly and they were large but just okay. The entrees were DELICIOUS. A gentleman checked on us and my sister asked about the birthday package for a 3rd time. He quickly brought over my crown that it seemed like everyone else had since they were seated. As a 50 yr old woman this was not a big deal to me but it was to my sister because she planned for this to be part of our evening. Our sever came halfway through our entrees to offer water for the first time. My sister pointed out that someone else had to bring the hat and her response was “well she has it now”. We also had to request our dessert which our neighboring table had already received and finished. The show was fun and entertaining and we will be back but I hope service improves otherwise I would skip dinner and watch from the bar.

A recommendation from a complete stranger we encountered walking on South Michigan. THANK YOU again sir! The wide open yet not loud atmosphere with televisions in every direction, a wonderful pub like menu and darn near every beer ever brewed on their menu made this a must try location while in Chicago! I had the rock shrimp and calamari and two IPA's that I had personally never tried. My friend went with the clam chowder that had chorizo in it, I didn't get his opinion mainly because after his first spoonful it was then devoured at a very rapid pace! Granted the basketball game hadn't started while we were there, but the service was some of the best that I've personally ever had been afforded the pleasure of having in many other cities.Great location, great atmosphere, good food and a spectacular beer list."

Yes, we wore our team gear inside and were polite and got on the wait list, they said 30 minutes, the place was packed at 10 am with the game starting at 2. One of the guys taking names told us there was some space at the back bar and walked us back there only to find there was no space, in the meantime, they never put our name on the list so several other parties were put on the list while we were being dragged to the back. Seemed like it was on purpose. Then there was no place to go except get shuffled around the front area. Bartenders were rude and ignored us. Greeters again said 30 min, but nothing was moving and we started seeing other parties behind us get seated. Food looked good, but we never got the chance to find out. Bottom line, maybe check this place out on a non game day but since Chicago is full of great places, you can skip it for the poor treatment. If you go on game day, my advise is to reserve a table, wear Bears gear over your team gear and then take it off after you are seated :). Funny thing is, we are lovers of football history and players, so we took all kinds of pictures of the Bears greats stuff on the walls at the stadium and my cat is named Payton, after Walter, not Manning.

Maybe they would have been better off making it a normal size sandwich, and maybe it was just a fluke. I like to give places the benefit of the doubt, so I won't say that I wouldn't go back. Seemed like a great sports bar."

My friend and I sat there looking at each other because the food came out so fast that we were afraid to eat it. Was it sitting around? Was it someone's else order that didn't want it? How did he know I would go for the Pot Roast?

This must have been the sweet spot between the 5 o'clock after work drinks crowd and the rowdy later Friday night crowd, because the place was just barely buzzing inside. Then again the outside patio was packed, no tables available. The weather was great so that's where everyone was sitting. Inside it was still nice because there are huge doors flung wide open so the sun and breeze can come in. I thought it was a great atmosphere. Tables were open for immediate seating. There are TV's absolutely everywhere. The inside has the traditional brick walls and wood beams.They had a pretty good beer list. Lots of wheat beers for me and some ciders for the wife. Between us we had a foot long grilled cheese (with bacon!) and the southern salad (it has buffalo chicken, black beans, etc). Both were fine. The grilled cheese was over the top. Lots of cheese, grilled in butter. All told we couldn't eat the whole sandwich. First of all, it was huge, second of all, it was just too rich. The place started to fill up with other people having dinner while we were there, and it was pretty full by the time we left. I believe they take reservations. I recommend The Scout as being one little step up from your average bar food. They do have goat cheese and duck on the menu, you won't find that in most bars. There were other things I would like to try next time. Cannot vouch for the late night atmosphere or the brunch, which I would like to try.Spent $44 total for two people with the food listed above, one beer each, including tax and tip."

Last night (4/4/12) at about 7pm (CST.), I decided to meet my friends at “The Scout” sports bar at 1301 S. Wabash here in Chicago to view the Miami HEAT vs. OKC game. To my dismay, there were no flat screens in the entire venue broadcasting the game. If you ever been to “The Scout” then you know they have over 20 flat screens in the venue. After ordering my food, I politely asked my server if she could change one of the many screens in the back of the establishment to the game. She replied: “sure let me get someone to change it for me”. I waited about 10 minutes but the game was never displayed on any monitors. I proceeded to ask a gentleman that I’ve seen working in a management capacity the same aforementioned question , and of course his reply was in sync with my server: “sure let me get someone to change it for me”. After an additional 10 more minutes of waiting, once my server arrived to serve my 2 friends, I asked if she could have the manager or the manager’s supervisor come to our table. [Side note: let me also say that while I was dressed down with a baseball cap and a fitted white v-neck shirt, I was never rude or belligerent. My friends and I are all 40 and professional. At this stage of our lives we know how to conduct ourselves in a public setting. (NOT THAT ANY OF THAT SHOULD MATTER !!!) ] After waiting 15 more minutes for the “non arrival” of the manager, I decided to go and ask for the manager myself. Yes, I’m fuming at this point because if nothing else he or she should have the common courtesy to at least respond to a customer request for his or her presence. I finally find this gentleman at the front podium and I politely ask if he’s the manger and his reply was “ yes”, so I asked him if he could change one of the many flat screens to the game and his response was ”we’re not turning our monitors to that game tonight”. I asked why and his response was like I said: ” we’re not turning our monitors to that game tonight”. I proceeded to say to him “So let me get this straight--- when venues are begging for customer support in the bar business, for no rhyme or reason, you’re not going to accommodate my request?” No response. With no further explanation offered, my friends and I paid our tab, tipped the server and left immediately. Yes, I had some very choice words that I wanted to impart to that guy but I bit my tongue. I couldn’t believe the treatment! In today’s economy, you make a conscious decision to treat people like dirt! I wanted to believe that we have surpassed so many of the color barrier issues! I was alarmed to discover that there are service providers still functioning in that traditional/primitive way of thinking! What was amazing to me is how we walked directly across the street to a packed FLOS & Santos and asked the gentleman behind the bar if he could turn 1 of only 5 TV’s to the game and he accommodated our request by turning the main screen on and was happy to have our business. We went on to spend $200.00 collectively. While this may not seem like much to you, as a small business owner in today’s economy, this is huge on a Wednesday night. Let me just conclude by saying you have a choice where you spend your dollar so make it a conscious one. I am making a conscious effort to NO LONGER support “The Scout” or any of its related functions!!."

Located at 1933 South Indiana Avenue in Chicago's McCormick Square, in the South Loop, next to the McCormick Convention Center, it has been specializing in raw fish, oysters, sushi, sashimi and other seafood since 2013. It has earned a reputation for ""best grilled oysters in Chicago"" and ""one of the top 21 oyster houses in the United States"" while serving customers in a bright and airy space with a modern flair. The oyster bar showcases more than 60 oyster selections from the East and West coasts. And if you are very thirsty, you can purchase a red wine by the bottle, Meritage, 1/6 Opus One, from Napa, California, for $595. We aren't wine drinkers, either. But there were plenty of tasty options to satisfy our tastebuds--and in our price range, too. We started with a plate of jumbo chilled shrimp, two bowls of New England clam chowder with fresh clams, potato, onion, carrots and celery and Caesar salad with romaine, croutons and parmesan cheese. For an entree, my wife chose grilled Scottish salmon topped with mint and basil sauce with steamed white rice and sauteed broccoli with garlic. I opted for a 10-ounce center cut filet with Wasabi mashed potatoes and sauteed baby spinach with garlic. For dessert, we shared a large slice of key lime pie and white chocolate blueberry cobbler. Chicago Oyster House is open from 5 to 9 Sunday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday and 5 to 10 on Friday and Saturday. Next time, I might be encouraged to discover if southern fried oysters are as good as they sound."

Tonight I went on my own during dinner which is probably more what people care about. I ordered a spicy appetizer and a more bland sushi (surf and turf) to counter that afterwards. The sushi came first (lobster and filet both cold) and the appetizer never came even after I paused multiple times to wait for it. When I finally asked the waiter told me the chef should be making it. The chef proceeded to make other sushis and I was about to say don’t worry about it when it came. Of course, my mouth was burning and I had no bland sushi to calm down my palate. I asked for the check and the waiter didn’t even offer to take the appetizer off or something else to make up for the wrong serving order. Overall, the restaurant didn’t have that many customers but just the dinner rush was too much for the wait staff.

Seriously.,"We took two business colleagues, and was met by a third one at this restaurant.  And it was my fault for forgetting, because someone had been to the restaurant the day before, and I had already been warned that there was no alcohol served there....I don't drink, so completely forgot about it, but it was a serious oversight according to the others with us.  On the bright side, it appears that the restaurant had a liquor license at one time, and presumably lost it.  So the wine glasses are still there, and you can bring your own bottle of wine and not worry about the corkage fee.  The food was generally very good.  The spring rolls with the peanut sauce was a little sweet for our taste and from the menu, we had not realized that it really was just filled with tofu, which was unpopular with the others (though they might have already been in a dismal mood owing to the absence of alcohol).  The duck with red curry sauce was excellent, as was the green papaya salad.  The fried spring rolls were also very good.  And the Tiger Cry beef was one of the highlights of the meal.  I will say that the restaurant is set up for mostly smaller groups.  We were seated as a group of four, and another colleague walked in and was sitting by himself, so we invited him to join us.  The restaurant seemed very displeased with our request to move to a different table so that we would be able to pull his table to join us.  So I guess the moral is that if you expect to have a larger group, better to advise the restaurant ahead of time, because they don't like last minute surprises.More"

The large restaurant was largely deserted and I was immediately seated and plied with ice water, which was refilled about six times by the attentive staff.Needing fuel for the tank, I ordered the Classic Reuben, Corned beef, swiss, sauerkraut and 1000 island dressing on marble rye ($9.50). Interestingly I was asked whether I wanted it ""open"" or ""closed""; I chose ""closed."" To double my comfort, I also ordered ""Kroll's Best"" Chocolate Milkshake ($4.50), with whipped cream.The Milkshake came first. So thick I really had to suck to get it started, it was everything a milkshake should be: creamy, rich, chocolatety, and huge. One of the best I've ever had in a long career of shakes.The Reuben was similarly excellent. Toasted, but not greasy. Piled high with tender corned beef with just enough melted Swiss cheese, sauerkraut and 1000 Island Dressing to make a blissful meld of flavors in every bite. The Reuben came with hot, crisp home-made fries. Comfort food to the max.Service was attentive, but not obtrusive. That water kept a coming.Having sated my hunger, stoked my engines, and rehydrated, I felt 200% better. Who could ask for more?Kroll's, while a sports bar was not loud and aggressively so; you could ""sports"" or not.

I will never order from this Pizanos again! I was given the wrong order. I ordered  half cheese and half sausage due to my roommate being vegetarian. Once the pizza arrived I noticed it was all sausage hence my roommate...cannot eat that pizza. I called to get it replaced and they stated that I have to return the current pizza in exchange for the new one. They also investigated and stated that their chefs did indeed make the correct pizza due to it being a slow night and questioned me. I stated I would be happy to send pictures of the full sausage pizza prior to being ate which they declined.Of course while waiting for the new pizza I ate my half of the pizza. I was then called by the Michael Austin (General Manager) who left a voicemail stating that I was not being “straight” with them and refused to deliver to my apartment again, he stated, “ I hope you enjoy your pizza tonight because that’s the last time we will be delivering to you.” I immediately called Michael back as I was very upset to find out being a loyal customer to Pizanos for them to think I was lying. Michael was very rude over the phone and did not show any sort of customer service. I stated to Michael that I would be happy to send the pictures to him to prove that I was not lying and I’m not trying to get a free pizza. I also stated that I worked in hospitality at Loews and would always order from them. In which he replied “I don’t need your resume”. He continued to declined and stated that if I choose  to order again that they will never deliver. I have never experience someone so unprofessional and disrespectful. I will not be ordering from them again and I am very disappointed that an experience like this from the general manager resulted in this.More"

The drink I ordered didn't taste sweet and tropical as it was described. My friend ordered food items that were not how they are typically made. She lived in Japan for three years and said the food she ordered was not real Japanese food. I had Philadelphia rolls and they were good. But you can't really go too wrong with those. Overall I think the food was too expensive for the quality it had.More"

On my subsequent call the same day, I was  told she had not arrived at the restaurant.  I never received a call back.  I called three days later, again, I was told Jessica was not in the restaurant and I left my name, number, and order number.  I never received a call back.  It's obvious I'm not going to get a call back.  Seems Jessica is only interested in getting the money and not repeat customers.

The US generally does better than other parts of the world (especially Europe) when it comes to service, but Kurah is NOT an example of this. Here's what...happened:   - Our table took 15 minutes to prepare, even though we had a reservation  - Our server took another 10 minutes to arrive  - She knew nothing about the menu, just reading descriptions from the printed page when we asked questions about dishes  - Our wine order was wrong, and then when it was corrected, the server just poured from the bottle without opening it in front of us or showing us the label (standard practice for any decent restaurant)  - Our first course took about 20 minutes to arrive, our next course was easily another 40-50 minutes. When we asked the server to check on the food, she said, ""I'll bring it out when it comes out, OK?""  - When the bill arrived, I noticed they had automatically added 20% gratuity, and had them remove it. I received multiple excuses during this process, including, ""We had a big party before you"", ""The bartender was slow""..... All of this when the restaurant was practically empty.  - Finally, there was a ""singer"" with a piano in the room who had the most atrocious voice. Painful.  I'd recommend this place be shut down.

Another staff person had to come over to...answer my question,""are the desserts  made in house (they are not)?"" When couples arrived, they were greeted warmly.  The staff even engaged them in limited conversation. As you enter the restaurant, it is cluttered and nasty looking. The inside is pleasant and very relaxing. The dish I ordered was Kage Shadow listed under Signature Japanese. My lunch was 5 star (*****). My dish was beautifully presented and delicious. One a scale of 1 - 10, it was a 10. FYI, I'm always respectful, easy going and a big tipper. So why one star? The staff made me feel like an interloper, because I dined alone. As I left, the staff person who answered my question regarding  their dessert menu, totally ignored me. Being treated in such a cold manner, spoiled my lunch. The staff at the Asian Outpost should  be trained to treat each customer respectfully and made to feel welcome.

This place really needs some refinement. First…the good. This place is in a great location and the South Loop desperately (and I mean desperately) needs some good restaurants. I can see that the...hundreds of people that walk by this place every day are intrigued by the name and the large menu; and the food (at least the Chinese, Thai and sushi part of the menu) is actually quite good. Stick to the egg rolls, Pad Thai, and fried rice and you won’t be disappointed. Their beer selection and some of their cocktails (like the Freaky Tiki and Asian Martinis) are also quite refreshing. Now…for the bad. As others have posted, this business is definitely geared towards take-out and delivery and stuck in a rut. The staff hasn’t been trained properly (Ever hear of a Chinese fire-drill? Watch the staff look for your bill). Your food and drinks will take at least 20 minutes to arrive (Don’t eat here if you’re in a hurry). The menu is way too big and confusing. (The Hawaiian, Korean and “Soul Food” part of the menu is pretty awful). Large menus like theirs are just obnoxious and in an Asian restaurant can be downright dangerous (The greasy fried items on the menu like the sliders and fried chicken should be renamed “Mao Tse Tung’s Revenge”). The interior décor is totally amateur and way too bright (You’ll need a pair of sunglasses and some SPF 45 to finish dinner). A hodgepodge of Asian trinkets and tableware lit by way too many halogen bulbs make this place look cheap and dated. When I hear “Asian Outpost” I want to see a charming import-export motif; shipping containers with Asian labels, pictures of exotic trading ports and the like not some hanging LED lights and Chinese lanterns from the year 1989. I really want to like this place but it needs a professional overhaul. Cut the menu in half, bring the staff and décor up to Chicago standards, make it more refined, less confusing and this restaurant could be the gem of the South Loop.More"

There were perhaps, four customers dining inside (they have Al Fresco dining). The waitress barely spoke English. Another staff person had to come over to...answer my question,""are the desserts  made in house (they are not)?"" When couples arrived, they were greeted warmly.  The staff even engaged them in limited conversation. As you enter the restaurant, it is cluttered and nasty looking. The inside is pleasant and very relaxing. The dish I ordered was Kage Shadow listed under Signature Japanese. My lunch was 5 star (*****). My dish was beautifully presented and delicious. One a scale of 1 - 10, it was a 10. FYI, I'm always respectful, easy going and a big tipper. So why one star? The staff made me feel like an interloper, because I dined alone. As I left, the staff person who answered my question regarding  their dessert menu, totally ignored me. Being treated in such a cold manner, spoiled my lunch. The staff at the Asian Outpost should  be trained to treat each customer respectfully and made to feel welcome. I've dined at many other neighborhood restaurants in the South Loop, where I'm made to feel welcomed and my wait person always acknowledges my departure. When you dine at the Asian Outpost, go with someone.More"

This place really needs some refinement. First…the good. This place is in a great location and the South Loop desperately (and I mean desperately) needs some good restaurants. I can see that the...hundreds of people that walk by this place every day are intrigued by the name and the large menu; and the food (at least the Chinese, Thai and sushi part of the menu) is actually quite good. Stick to the egg rolls, Pad Thai, and fried rice and you won’t be disappointed. Their beer selection and some of their cocktails (like the Freaky Tiki and Asian Martinis) are also quite refreshing. Now…for the bad. As others have posted, this business is definitely geared towards take-out and delivery and stuck in a rut. The staff hasn’t been trained properly (Ever hear of a Chinese fire-drill? Watch the staff look for your bill). Your food and drinks will take at least 20 minutes to arrive (Don’t eat here if you’re in a hurry). The menu is way too big and confusing. (The Hawaiian, Korean and “Soul Food” part of the menu is pretty awful). Large menus like theirs are just obnoxious and in an Asian restaurant can be downright dangerous (The greasy fried items on the menu like the sliders and fried chicken should be renamed “Mao Tse Tung’s Revenge”). The interior décor is totally amateur and way too bright (You’ll need a pair of sunglasses and some SPF 45 to finish dinner). A hodgepodge of Asian trinkets and tableware lit by way too many halogen bulbs make this place look cheap and dated. When I hear “Asian Outpost” I want to see a charming import-export motif; shipping containers with Asian labels, pictures of exotic trading ports and the like not some hanging LED lights and Chinese lanterns from the year 1989. I really want to like this place but it needs a professional overhaul. Cut the menu in half, bring the staff and décor up to Chicago standards, make it more refined, less confusing and this restaurant could be the gem of the South Loop.More"

To start off the customer service was terrible.  I sat, and two other parties came after me whose order was taken rather quickly.    I ordered simple things; Mango Lassi, Vegetable Momo, Tandoori Prawn, and...garlic naan.  The Lassi was incredibly sweet and not made with fresh mango.  The Vegetable Momo had really good flavor yet put together real sloppy so they did not stand up trying to dip in the sauce.  The Garlic Naan came about 10 minutes after my food and was cold plus did not taste cooked.  The shrimp was literally killed, they were so overcooked it was even difficult to cut.  The server never came by to ask how things are and when I asked for the check, they asked if I wanted to take the food home, I said it was so overcooked it was not edible and the naan was cold to start.  They said ok and brought my bill.  I told the man at the front about the shrimp as I left, and they looked at me like I was nuts and said ok.  This is one place I WILL NEVER COME back to.  Service gets a ZERO, the Food a 1 because the momo had flavor.  Not sure how it stays open with service like that.More"

I had the fish and chips with the friend pickles, my son ordered the fish tacos, my wife ordered the crab cakes, and my daughter ordered mashed potatoes (side) and a ceasar salad. The friend pickles and steak fries that came with my order were solid but had no interesting spices or flavors. The fish (cod) was fine with a thick batter which allowed the fish to squish out when you tried to cut it - this was not a problem. Fish and chips is typically on the blander side of things, but the batter was just ...batter...nothing interesting. The fish tacos had pico de gallo, but you couldn't taste the separate components. It all just kind of blended together. IMHO, a good and interesting dish combines the blending of flavors, separating out the distincting components, and makes it interesting with different textures. This had none of that. Crab cakes were bleh according to my wife. I tried the mashed potatoes - they were buttery and smooth, but nothing else.

The fish (cod) was fine with a thick batter which allowed the fish to squish out when you tried to cut it - this was not a problem. Fish and chips is typically on the blander side of things, but the batter was just ...batter...nothing interesting. The fish tacos had pico de gallo, but you couldn't taste the separate components. It all just kind of blended together. IMHO, a good and interesting dish combines the blending of flavors, separating out the distincting components, and makes it interesting with different textures. This had none of that. Crab cakes were bleh according to my wife. I tried the mashed potatoes - they were buttery and smooth, but nothing else. If you like interesting flavors and textures  in your food - this is not the place for you. If, however, you prefer your food bland and non-adventurous -  to basically fill you up, then this would be a great place for you.More"

We had been going all weekend. We had enough time to have a nice sit down bite before we left for the airport.  Not quite enough to go downtown to a “better” restaurant so we decided to...give this a try since it was in our hotel.  The hotel it’s self is great and the staff is awesome. Woven and Bound not so much. We were in during the early afternoon about 2:00. The place was not very busy and we were seated by a few other groups.  Not long after we were seated one of the people in one of the other groups got up and hunted down one of the servers. I wasn’t sure what the issue was but I soon found out. We waited for 10 mins before a server acknowledged us. Even then it was I’ll be right with you.  He then went to the table where people had complained and took their order, then another table and then us. He took our order very curtly and left. Mind you he had not even given us water. We ordered an iced tea and waters with the meal. Another 5-10 mins went by and no water or anything. There were three or four wait staff looking like they were doing things but obviously were not. I got up and asked one of them for our iced tea and water. Several minutes later she showed up with a pot of hot tea and no water. I told her we wanted iced tea and water. She looked annoyed that she had not listened and gotten the wrong kind of tea for us. Like it was our fault. Eventually we got our drinks.  We sat for about 20 mins. Waters and tea empty and no food. It wasn’t just us. There were people having to flag down staff for their checks, more water and wondering when food was coming. Finally he filled our water and tea. Then waited a bit more for food. I will say the food was good. One of the group felt their burger was dry and not that good but the turkey sandwich I had was good. We asked for our bill as soon as the food came since our time was now tighter than it should have been to make our flight.  The check came out and it was wrong. We were double charged for a couple items. One of which was iced tea. Who charges $4 for a Lipton style iced tea?  He fixed the double charges and gave us our corrected bill. We paid and left.  If it had been super busy or there wasn’t much staff, I could understand some of the wait. But there were 4 servers and maybe 12 groups in the restaurant.  I think you would be best served going to a better place downtown or just plan on paying more and waiting longer for good but not great food.More"

We had been going all weekend. We had enough time to have a nice sit down bite before we left for the airport.  Not quite enough to go downtown to a “better” restaurant so we decided to...give this a try since it was in our hotel.  The hotel it’s self is great and the staff is awesome. Woven and Bound not so much. We were in during the early afternoon about 2:00. The place was not very busy and we were seated by a few other groups.  Not long after we were seated one of the people in one of the other groups got up and hunted down one of the servers. I wasn’t sure what the issue was but I soon found out. We waited for 10 mins before a server acknowledged us. Even then it was I’ll be right with you.  He then went to the table where people had complained and took their order, then another table and then us. He took our order very curtly and left. Mind you he had not even given us water. We ordered an iced tea and waters with the meal. Another 5-10 mins went by and no water or anything. There were three or four wait staff looking like they were doing things but obviously were not. I got up and asked one of them for our iced tea and water. Several minutes later she showed up with a pot of hot tea and no water. I told her we wanted iced tea and water. She looked annoyed that she had not listened and gotten the wrong kind of tea for us. Like it was our fault. Eventually we got our drinks.  We sat for about 20 mins. Waters and tea empty and no food. It wasn’t just us. There were people having to flag down staff for their checks, more water and wondering when food was coming. Finally he filled our water and tea. Then waited a bit more for food. I will say the food was good. One of the group felt their burger was dry and not that good but the turkey sandwich I had was good. We asked for our bill as soon as the food came since our time was now tighter than it should have been to make our flight.  The check came out and it was wrong. We were double charged for a couple items. One of which was iced tea. Who charges $4 for a Lipton style iced tea?  He fixed the double charges and gave us our corrected bill. We paid and left.  If it had been super busy or there wasn’t much staff, I could understand some of the wait. But there were 4 servers and maybe 12 groups in the restaurant.  I think you would be best served going to a better place downtown or just plan on paying more and waiting longer for good but not great food.More"

Walked into this rooftop with a reservation. Greeted by Lenell who is the security at the door. I showed him the reservation, which the confirmation...is attached to this post. I was told that he could Not find our reservation in the portal. Even told that maybe I did something wrong. Clearly, the reservation says confirmed. Also even have the $1 charge they deducted from my account to hold the reservation.  I’m confused and decide to sit, reflect, and look further into the reservation system. Behind me was a woman that did not have a reservation. She walks up and chat with Lenell, who whispers that he will allow her upstairs to a table. She walks out to go and get a girlfriend for their table that was graciously given to them by Mr. Lenell.  Just as he turns she walks away, in walk three other people experience the exact same issue as me originally. Meaning, they present a confirmation for a reservation and is told that they can’t be found in the system.  One of the gentleman from the group speak to Mr. Lenell, who in turn allow them upstairs for drinks at the bar.  I'm listening and floored. I approach him and ask if we could sit at the bar for drinks.  We wait and ultimately refused to the rooftop. So, I notice Mr. lenell speaking to a guy about walk ins. U inquire if that is the manager.  He informs me that his name is Chris. We review everything that happened above. I’m told to restate things about the situation, which I do a review for Chris. I’m then informed to calm down. Just then, Mr. No Name Interjects to inform us that the group let up earlier did not have a reservation, and that he allowed an additional person from their party up to join them. This enrages me as I am explaining exactly what Mr. No Name interjects with to Chris as a major problem. He listens but doesn't remedy the situation.

Only drawback I had is getting fixed soon, and that is the lack of a close train stop. The beers were cheap and the bar staff was quick to get to you. We had drinks in the downstairs bar, the rooftop deck (awesome), and even down in the music venue before the concert started and we were told to clear the area. The rooftop was the coolest spot, but obviously with it being Chicago in early November the weather was a little chilly. I could see this place killing it in the spring and summer.

Located at 1251...South Prairie Avenue, near Grant Park, the Field Museum, the Shedd Aquarium and the Prairie Avenue Historic District, Little Branch Cafe has been satisfying customers since 2007. It's advertised as a hip American restaurant and coffeehouse with a full bar and patio that serves delicious breakfast and lunch fare and a distinct brand of coffee from 7 to 7 daily. The breakfast menu includes omelettes, pancakes, French toast and waffles. My wife chooses either a cinnamon raisin waffle topped with caramelized nuts or old-fashioned French toast with a chick cut brioche, sweet cream and fresh strawberries. My favorite is oatmeal with cream, brown sugar, cinnamon, nuts and berries with two scrambled eggs, chicken sausage, hash browns and an English muffin. Lunch? Start with the soup of the day. Then flip a coin and select one of six sandwiches--smoked salmon, turkey Reuben, tuna melt, blue cheese burger, Philly steak or fried tilapia. If none of those agrees with your palate, there are several other options that I'm sure will. Whatever you choose, you'll be ready for a full day of visiting some of Chicago's most popular tourist attractions.More"

Fortunately we live in the area so we frequent it often.  The food is excellent and always well prepared.  They started as a coffee shop and have grown to serve great breakfasts and lunches...as well as smoothies. Try the LBC Burger.  It may be the best cheese burger in the city.  Also check out the breakfast croissant sandwich.  My grandkids love the pancakes and their parents are happy because they also get fresh fruit with the pancakes. My wife says the Veggie Burger is the best she has ever eaten.  During the warm weather Little Branch has outdoor eating available.  Parking can be tough in this area.More

It was a weekday and around 5 PM and they were busier than the last trips.  They may have been slightly understaffed as there...was tables available, but a wait to be seated.   Once seated, we ordered and the drinks came out fairly quickly, but the food took long enough to make us think that the food was taking a long time to come out.  Meanwhile, the bread service was pretty good.  Once the food came out, the dinner itself went fine.  I ended up with a burger which was good.  Not anything outstanding, but good.  Everyone was happy with their meals.  Refills were provided by someone other than our regular server and they were will quick.  We even got an ice water pitch for our table.  That was great after walking all day.  Then the wait started.  Our server apparently set our 3 check down at an empty table about 3 tables away and we sat there for 30 minutes tapping our fingers.  I was staring at the checks, thinking that they were ours, but nobody came around to check on us.  The server apparently realized we didn't have our bills yet and scooped them off the table and brought them to us.  It took another 10 minutes to run the cards and bring them back.  It took a grand total of 1 hour and 35 minutes to have our meal.  That's a long time for a burger.  The positive was that we missed some rush hour traffic on our way out of town.

Out of the four dishes I tasted from our group only the  gnocchi impressed .  The veal was over cooked and the  tortellini was just ok.

The rice and beans didn’t have any seasoning just rice and beans from the can! Yep I said CAN! The cabbage was mediocre at its best! As stated before, the waiter never was horrible and never refilled our water glasses, that he clearly saw us drinking, because he kept refilling the tables beside us!! Then to make matters worse, we kept getting attacked by GNATS!! Yep I said GNATS! Oh but it didn’t end there, the waiter added a tip to our receipt and recharged the card!! Save your money!!

I walked there from my hotel. The decor was very clean and nice.  It was a...Wednesday evening and there were only 3 tables being used.  Looking over the menu, I was torn between their sampler, the Jerk Catfish and the short ribs. I stuck with what caught my eye in the first place and chose the Jerk Catfish with cabbage, red beans and rice, and I ordered a side of the cream style cornbread. After the first bite of the Jerk chicken I was pitying all of the people with whom I walked past to get here eating overpriced hotel food.  The catfish was fork tender charred perfectly.  The cabbage was so good I would come back just for that.  I mean really? Cabbage?  YES!   The Red beans and rice was also good, but the star of the show was the Jerk Catfish.  Of course I cannot leave out the Cream Style Corn Bread. Had I not seen the dessert menu, I would have been quite satisfied with the Corn bread as being my dessert, it was so good.  On their dessert list they have Rum Raisin Sunday and Fried Beignets.  My server suggested getting the Fried Beignets ala mode in which I did.  I normally don't eat dessert but it was incredible. The beignets were delightfully crunchy on the outside and soft and moist on the inside.  With the thousands upon thousands of people attending conventions at McCormick this place should be packed with a line waiting out the door.  I can't wait to waste time at a convention so that I could eat once again at the 14 Parish.  As much as I loved the Jerk Catfish next time it will be the sampler. (and cabbage and corn bread and then the Rum Raisin Sundae)  You must go visit 14 Parish, you will thank me later.More"

Ordered at 7:40 pm on a Friday, got an email response saying I'd be eating in 30-40 minutes.  At 8:40 I called the store (80 E. Cermak) and a rude employee insisted that the email I was reading from must say...an hour to an hour-and-a-half.  (Apparently she was a magician of some kind.)  Probably sensing that I wanted to cancel the order, she then told me the pizza ""left the store at 8:35.""  How convenient!  Just before I called!    In any event the pizza didn't arrive until 9:20.  I've driven from Cermak to the Loop before.  It doesn't take 45 minutes, even if you stop twice along the way.  The pizza itself was a cold, disgusting glob of congealed grease, stuck to the bottom of a pizza box that had been totally discolored by oil seeping through the smiling face of Papa John himself.  The breadsticks were even worse and were promptly thrown down the trash chute.  Whatever hotness and freshness this food once had was destroyed by the passage of time -- 60-70 minutes, I would guess.    At least the delivery man was apologetic, but that's sad in and of itself.  It's not his fault Papa John's doesn't hire enough drivers to serve densely populated areas.  I am routinely blown away by the quality, service, and taste of Domino's.  Domino's beats the pants out of Papa John's in every conceivable metric.  Why we veered off course this time to Papa John's I will never know.

If you are a Shedd Member you get a discount.  If you only want water, ask for a paper cup.  You can bring in granola bars, fruit etc. and share that to make your meal more complete or healthy. It isn't fast food like McD or BK, so you do pay more for it, someone has to do the dishes and clear the trays. The bathrooms are just a short distance away.
