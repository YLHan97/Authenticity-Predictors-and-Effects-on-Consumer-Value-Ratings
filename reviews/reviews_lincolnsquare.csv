Gather is known for gather and share, with multiple small plates to share, appetizers and reasonably sized entrees.  Our group of 5 had 4 share plates, one appetizer and two entrees all of which were shared and was just the right...amount of food- although the apple fritter dessert did put us a bit over the edge…:).    All of the food was very good, the highlights were the crispy cauliflower, gnocchi, and the ravioli appetizer, plus the pork shoulder which was fall off the bone tender with an interesting curry/tomato sauce.  Drinks were well made, service was excellent so the evening at Gather was outstanding.More"

Like, cannot hear the person next to you loud.  The waiter came over and with his nice, quiet voice explained everything to us, with our party catching about every 4th word he said.  ""Tonight.... meat.... plate.... sauce....basil....""...Yeah, it is hard to understand anything communicated in this space.    If they are not going to do anything to try and quiet the sound levels, then they need to have whatever the wait staff is trying to say WRITTEN OUT for guests.  The food was delcious.  Fun for sharing.  But again, when it arrives, don't expect to hear what you are eating before you dig in.More"

Gather,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g35805-d4719626-Reviews-Gather-Chicago_Illinois.html,"August 20, 2019",4,Nice brunch or dinner,"As you can see I have been to both Gather and the adjacent Warbler in the past for dinners. Both places have the same owner. I like both places for different reasons.   My party of three recently returned to Gather two times, once for dinner...and then again for brunch. Let me first describe our dinner experience. Gather is a shared plate dinner experience. We started with the kimchi pancake for $12 and the salmon for $13. Then we enjoyed the tartare for $13 and the brussel sprouts for $9. We ended with the uovo ravioli for $11. As you can see from my pics I enjoyed two overnight sensation cocktails for $10 each.  John took care of our table needs. Our total bill was $132 less gratuities.  Then we returned for my first time here for my party of three for our 11:00am brunch reservation. When we arrived we were seated at the high top table nearest to the front entrance behind the host. The place was packed with customers.   I started with my bloody mary for $8. I also enjoyed my eggs benedict for $13. My eggs benedict were a bit over cooked. I really prefer a very liquid egg yolk. A side order of bacon is $5. A single scrambled egg is $1.50.  I ended my brunch with my bellini for $9. A cup of coffee is $4. Our total bill was $92.07 less gratuities. Courtney accommodated our table needs. I will return here again for dinner, brunch or even lunch.More"

We called early in the day knowing that reservations were not available.  We were told that if we would likely get seated at a table if we arrived right when the restaurant opened.  We were surprised, then, when we arrived to an...empty restaurant, as the second couple in line, and tables were no longer available for those without reservations.  (Apparently there was a party that evening; your mileage may vary.)    We had the option of sitting at the Chef's counter or the bar.  At first we were both surprised and annoyed at not getting a table.  But silly us.  Sitting at the Chef's bar was fantastic.  Gather has a very small kitchen, and the three chefs/cooks shared the space very well.  It was a treat to watch them prepare all the dishes, including the ones that we ordered.  The fresh homemade cheese dessert is outstanding.  The whole meal was very good -- salmon, tartare, apple salad, scallop main, and the wines.  We shared the scallop main and the server recommended an extra scallop; we appreciated that they could accommodate.  The all-in price for two people for dinner (sharing one main) with alcohol and tip was $137.More"

I had the Biscuits and Gravy and don't think I've ever had better biscuits. The gravy was tangy, the chicken sausage had just the right blend of spices, and it was topped with two over-easy eggs.Heavenly and so filling. One other member of our party had this dish, and we agreed that there was nothing else like it. Another family member had Shrimp and Grits, leaving none on the plate, and kept invading my plate for ""just a taste."" The pre-teen in the group opted for Brioche French Toast, which he devoured.

We sat at the counter, overlooking the kitchen. What a wonderful experience. Gather is a small restaurant so sitting at the counter really felt homey. Service was perfect. We loved our waitress and the support staff. We particularly liked talking to the three chefs cooking the food in front of us. The overall menu is small and it was interesting to see how a few dishes were so popular. The chefs took great pride in the combination of their ingredients, how fresh and tasty their dishes are, and their favorites on the menu. We started with the winter radishes and the Spring greens salad. Both were large and easy to share. The salads were crunchy with lots of texture and flavor. Next we got the homemade spaghetti and the fried chicken. The fried chicken was one of the best dishes I've had anywhere in a long time. I can't tell you how many chicken dishes came out of the kitchen- clearly others loved it too! The other really popular dish was the steak.

Service was excellent, but what they put on the plate was even better. We chose the five course prix fixe dinner. Each dish was on the menu, but Chef Ken Carter picked his freshest favorites and he outdid himself. First course was a lovely beef carpaccio served with red potato chips and veggies. Next we had a take on insalata caprese, with heirloom tomatoes and burrata and basil. A surprise course was roasted peppers with some sort of magical treatment on top. I believe it was a salted fish flaked so thin that it seemed to come alive as the steam rose from the peppers. Delicious and entertaining. There were two mains, a lovely seared scallop first. In my mind, the chicken course was memorable. There were three small pieces of chicken. The breast slices were over the top tender and juicy, possibly sous vide? What I love was the delicately fried chunk of crusted dark meat that was an amazing contrast. They spoiled us with desert and we all walked away full, not stuffed, and happy. My descriptions do not capture the freshness and flavor. You'll just have to go yourself. You won't be disappointed."

Finally I got up and flagged our server who was efficient friendly but clearly had too many tablesAfter we ordered we did get our food fairly quickly and our cocktails finally came It is quite apparent that they were not prepared for the crowd which was due to The large commercial furnishings Neocon show at the Merch Mart .

Goosefoot proved those misconceptions so...wrong.  We walked in and were immediately greeted by Nina by name which made me feel very at home and she showed us our table..The theme of Goosefoot for this season is Woodstock and the music the atmosphere and the food has touches of woodstock going through. The thing that made the night special besides the food was the incredible service and just personal attention received by Nina who shared history on the restaurant and the dishes and made the time go by fast.  The was never a lull in between courses as Nina was keeping us attentive and in suspense for the next course and of course we could see the other tables receiving theirs.  The mean started off with the fois gras and the chestnut soup..so delicious, we then had the scallop in the lobster broth..we both wanted more and more of this...the parsnip soup was hearty and delicious with the lentils at the bottom adding a nice texture, then venison entree and the beef...creative, succulent and juicy and perfect especially when all the bits are added together. then we had the cheese course piped in the egg shell, the yuzu palate cleanser presented with the mini replicas of the bandshell at Millenium Park, amazingly creative with the origami touches, we then moved on to dessert which after the custard and the snow globe chocolate, we were so full which was a shock..we had to take the final desserts and the chocolate bars home.  Nina was a delight, the food each course so unique and full of flavor and presented with such precision.  If this is what Michelin is all about then i want this as much as i can.

As a hostess who has brought others to this restaurant for important celebrations in the past (and therefore talked it up to my current guest), I was embarrassed.  As a foodie who paid a substantial...price for the meal, I was very disappointed. This is not a personal criticism; Nina is a lovely hostess... My only guess is that the couple's endeavor to create a little shop next store and Chris' stated passion to create a ""chocolate lab"" has depleted resources, such that the restaurant has suffered. The scallops and corn crab soup were good; the pasta was average (expected better); the beef was just okay; the pink peppercorn dish was completely out of balance, the coffee dessert (which I think was supposed to be panna cotta?) was way too thick. In general, portion sizes were off. Oddly, the special toppings (e.g., froth on the soup and dessert) were more something you had to work your way through to get to the dish, rather than serving as a complement to the dish in terms of flavor.  The central theme of Woodstock would have been okay if it made sense; but it didn't (e.g., small cow figurines and colored paper trees??) One of the dishes arrived on a platter for 2 with a 3-D bumblebee made of paper in the center; the meaning of the bee was entirely lost on both me and my guest, and again, just odd. It felt as though they were using old ideas and presentations without putting in the time to be properly thoughtful about the meal as a whole (portions, presentations, flavors) or about making a cohesive story of the theme.  It would seem better to just not have a theme than to keep referring to one that doesn't come through (i.e., make sense). My guest is a foodie too and so, I was in the awkward position of having to acknowledge that the food and presentation were not up to par because they clearly just were not. I think it would be helpful for the owners to either streamline their side businesses so as not to detract from the restaurant or to hire someone to think more carefully about the menu before they lose their local good standing.More"

Goosefoot,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g35805-d2453785-Reviews-Goosefoot-Chicago_Illinois.html,"May 5, 2019",3,Restaurant decline perhaps associated w new store...,"Went to Goose Foot for an important celebration this weekend.  As a hostess who has brought others to this restaurant for important celebrations in the past (and therefore talked it up to my current guest), I was embarrassed.  As a foodie who paid a substantial...price for the meal, I was very disappointed. This is not a personal criticism; Nina is a lovely hostess... My only guess is that the couple's endeavor to create a little shop next store and Chris' stated passion to create a ""chocolate lab"" has depleted resources, such that the restaurant has suffered. The scallops and corn crab soup were good; the pasta was average (expected better); the beef was just okay; the pink peppercorn dish was completely out of balance, the coffee dessert (which I think was supposed to be panna cotta?) was way too thick. In general, portion sizes were off. Oddly, the special toppings (e.g., froth on the soup and dessert) were more something you had to work your way through to get to the dish, rather than serving as a complement to the dish in terms of flavor.  The central theme of Woodstock would have been okay if it made sense; but it didn't (e.g., small cow figurines and colored paper trees??) One of the dishes arrived on a platter for 2 with a 3-D bumblebee made of paper in the center; the meaning of the bee was entirely lost on both me and my guest, and again, just odd. It felt as though they were using old ideas and presentations without putting in the time to be properly thoughtful about the meal as a whole (portions, presentations, flavors) or about making a cohesive story of the theme.  It would seem better to just not have a theme than to keep referring to one that doesn't come through (i.e., make sense). My guest is a foodie too and so, I was in the awkward position of having to acknowledge that the food and presentation were not up to par because they clearly just were not. I think it would be helpful for the owners to either streamline their side businesses so as not to detract from the restaurant or to hire someone to think more carefully about the menu before they lose their local good standing.More"

I didn't believe it until I saw it for myself. It's a seafood restaurant with a patio that offers 16 varieties of fresh fish, some from Hawaii, and 25 brands of cereal for all-day breakfast. To call it a...diner is a gross misrepresentation. In my day, a diner was known as a ""greasy spoon,"" a hamburger joint. Sit at the counter and watch the chef flip burgers on a grill. Located at 1820 West Montrose Avenue in Chicago's Ravenswood neighborhood, at Honore, between Ashland and Damen, Glenn's Diner prides itself on New England clam chowder with bacon and key lime pie, testimony to its sea-going motif. Open from 4 to 8 on Tuesday and Wednesday, 11 to 8 on Thursday and Friday, 10 to 9 on Saturday and 10 to 8 on Sunday, this is the kind of restaurant you'd expect to find on a Florida beach. I came for Glenn's cheeseburger consisting of a house-made half-pound of certified Angus beef with lettuce, tomato, American cheese and 1,000 Island dressing on a sesame seed bun and the blackened swordfish sandwich with tartar sauce, lettuce, tomato and onion on a buttered bun. But I was blown away by the list of fresh fish, each served with potato and vegetables. My wife's favorites are grouper and mahi mahi. My favorites are Alaskan halibut and whitefish. The list also includes swordfish, pretzel crusted walleye, rainbow trout, lake trout, Scottish salmon, yellow fin tuna, red snapper, Dover Sole, Columbia River sturgeon, Arctic char, sea scallop, catfish, yellow lake perch, lobster and Alaskan King crab legs. Start with gorgonzola garlic bread and coconut shrimp. The hard part is to choose which fish you prefer. If you have a hunger for fresh fish, there is no ""Finer Diner"" than Glenn's.More"

Last night, after a long hiatus, we returned. To say that we were disappointed is an understatement. The menu is basically the same (but see below), but the prices are much...higher.  My favorite dish in the past was the lake perch, which was sauteed in butter and garlic. It was truly one of the best seafood dishes I have ever eaten anywhere.  Not so last night. The perch seem to have been deep fried, although the menu described the preparation as dipped in flour and pan fried.  What I was served was heavily breaded and cooked to death.  I left most of it on the plate.  Another member of our party had the halibut, which looked, and which was described by her as dry.  A third at our table had the ruby red trout which was cooked well and very tasty.  We waited slightly longer than usual for our food to be served, and when it was served it was not hot.  The perch is served with a very nice garlic butter which I asked for on the side. The perch and accompanying broccoli were not hot enough to melt the butter.  Overall I would not recommend the ""new"" Glenn's and I will not be returning.More"

In fact, all-you-can-eat-cereal is one of the restaurant's staples. And breakfast is served all day. But the primary attraction is seafood, fresh fish, even species that you've never...heard of, from Hawaii to Idaho, from Australia to Maryland, from Peru to Alaska, from Scotland to Tazmania, from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, from the Arctic to the Great Lakes. Located at 1820 West Montrose Avenue on Chicago's Northwest Side, in the Ravenswood neighborhood, Glenn's Diner was created from a desire to re-invent the diner. They advertise the ""best New England clam chowder west of the Atlantic Ocean"" and the ""best shrimp cocktail in the world."" They also prepare over 16 fish items daily. ""More than any other restaurant in Chicago,"" they claim. And it's fresh, flown in daily from here, there and everywhere. As an advocate of a more fish/less meat diet, I can only attest to one thing: Glenn's Diner prepares a lot of fish, some I've never heard of before, but it's all fresh and delicious. It's fun to try new items, like Columbia River Sturgeon, Gonzo Tiger Shrimp, Blue Striped Marlin, Tazmanian King Salmon, Mako Shark, Hawaiian Ruby Red Tuna, Australian Silver Barramundi and Big Mamou Peruvian Blue. Most of the time, however, my wife and I prefer old favorites, like Mahi Mahi, Scottish salmon, Dover Sole, Idaho rainbow trout, Alaskan halibut, red snapper, striped sea bass and Lake perch.

The server was very knowledgeable, the wine prices are good with only what looked to be 100% mark up and the seafood is plentiful and well priced. We had the char, coba and the bass. All were prepared well, presented well and tasted great. The chowder was outstanding. I can't wait to go back. The bonus is we found out you can bring your own wine for a $5 charge which is a bargain."

We we're visiting in the Evanston, Ill area and knew we had to pay a visit. We were not disappointed. The place is small, has only about 15 tables. We had reservations on a Wednesday night but there were always 1 or 2 empty tables so a walk-in would have been fine. Nevertheless I would get a reservation, especially on weekends. Because it was crowded, it was noisy but you can carry on a conversation.But the reason we went was becasue of the food and we were glad we did. The dinner menu is on two large blackboards on two sides of the room. There were at least 16 different seafood dinners (not counting appetizers), a boneless chop, spaghetti & meatballs, and ribs. I saw no poultry on the dinner menu. My family got the barramundi and swordfish and I got the cioppino. The cioppino was the best I have ever had & I've ordered it on the west and east coasts many times. The serving was huge (it really should be shared with someone else), had tons of seafood and just the right amount of zip. The other seafood was cooked perfectly. Our teenager finished off with the bananas foster and was deeply satsified. This is by far the best seafood restaurant in the Chicago area. It is right next to the Montrose exit of the Brown ""L"" line so you can get to it from any place in town without any problems. Come prepared for excellent food at very reasonable prices."

The fish is fantastic and very fresh, but they run out of it quickly as they only have a limited qty so make sure to go early in the evening. The clam chowder is fantastic which they always have. Keep in mind this place still has diner status, so it is not fancy, it is casual and they serve cereal...Reservations recommended!"

We love the convenience of the Brown line stop a block from the restaurant. The fish is very fresh. Excellent quality which is why we went back a second time. We were disappointed in the preparation of our dishes. The walleye pike had a heavy (as in chunky) pretzel breading. If the breading had been finer it might have been enjoyable but it covered the delightful flavor of the fish. The Artic Char was also very fresh but overpowered by a shrimp diablo sauce.Very disappointing given the prices ($18-28 an entree). Earlier last year when we ate there the first time we had no complaints. In fact we loved how the preparation seemed to complement the chosen fish.

Located at 4729 North Lincoln Avenue, southeast...of the busy intersection of Lawrence, Lincoln and Western, between Lawrence and Leland, adjacent to Giddings Plaza, it is a Euro-style cafe/bakery serving upscale American comfort food with every sweet treat from pumpkin bread to cinnamon bun to banana eclair to salted caramel brownies to raspberry chocolate tart to apple strudel to chocolate mousse torte to tiramisu to German chocolate cake to caramel apple bread pudding to banana truffle torte to strawberry roulade. Order online for carryout or delivery, then pick up your order inside the cafe at the bakery counter. For lunch, my wife had a bowl of tomato bisque soup with an eight-ounce Wagyu beef burger with applewood smoked bacon and caramelized onions on a toasted pretzel bun. I couldn't resist the chicken pot pie with chicken breast, baby peas, carrots and pearl onions in a cream sauce topped with an all-butter puff pastry. Then it's time for a difficult decision. What to take home from the bakery? On this occasion, we settled for a loaf of pumpkin bread, a half-dozen oatmeal raisin cookies, a raspberry chocolate tart, a chocolate mousse torte and a portion of caramel apple bread pudding. But I hated to leave a German chocolate cake and banana eclairs behind. Next time for sure.More"

Seeing the sign in the distance, and burning daylight, I hoofed it on down.  Since ANY claim laid to regional authenticity depends on there being more than ONE purveyor...of same, I question on principle the ""quad-cities"" concept.  I've delved deeply into the dish with Chicago pies, danced through odd combinations (Canadian bacon, shrimp, pineapple) in Stockholm, so now a puffy hand-tossed malt sweetened crust?  Why not?  I opted for the pulled pork variant, with its branded bbq sauce.    Two notables: there's a generous circumference of crust bereft of any topping. Also, the shredded cheese is added last, so it's not exactly melted or bubbly.  Curious. Had to check twice, but I wasn't imagining a sprinkle of cole slaw under the cheese. Edible - yes. Pizza - well maybe.  Served scissor-cut into strips and eaten on odd wooden ""plates"", I feel a point is being made here.  Like the noble hipster, are we different for our own sake??  Final comment needed on the cost: this place ain't cheap!  Were it not for the happy accident of ""half-price pizza happy hour"", into which I luckily fell, this $28 item would have suffered a harsh valuation.  Even at $14, for the quantity of pork presented, it's tres cher.    I applaud their farm-to-table sourcing, even making their own sausage in-house.  Sadly, this approach is best suited to an exclusive bistro, whose cuisine justifies and can absorb the extra cost.  Time will only tell if novelty alone creates a niche.More"

The sausage market offers more than 40 varieties of sausage, from Kielbasa to bratwurst to salami to Polish sausage to Alpine sausage to kiszka to knackwurst to smoked pork to smoked ham to garlic Old Word Krakow sausage. The deli offers 30 home-made sliced meats, imported chocolates and cookies, German limburger, spaetzle, smoked fish, cured herring, smoked bacon, smoked pork loin, daily special such as cabbage rolls, blintzes, stuffed duck, schnitzel, Hungarian goulash, kolaczki, ciabatta, pretzels, poppy seed cake, German Stollen and chrusciki. Not to mention sandwiches such as corned beef, roast beef, honey ham and turkey breast. And the liquor department offers imported wine, beer and liquor.

Their website had photos of the dishes on the menu.  The three of us decided to try it.  On a bitterly cold winter night we found street parking right in...front of the restaurant.  There were only a few occupied tables at 6:30 pm but they were doing a good takeout business from a window facing the kitchen.  It was fortunate we had studied the menu because our waitress had little English, being a recent arrival from Kazakhstan.  We ordered the big plate of assorted traditional dishes which featured several types of dumplings, a shredded cabbage dish, plov, lagman noodles with beef, and a couple other items to sample as much as possible.  We also had ""Jibek Jolu special"" salad, a dish of plov (a rice dish flavored with meat and veggies) and lagman with lamb  (hand-pulled noodles with a separate tomato-ey, vinegary sauce).    The food came quickly.  It was a plentiful amount, quite tasty and filling.  It was not at all spicy, altho there was a small glass condiment jar of ground red chilis on the table to spice up the dishes, if desired.  I tried it but didn't think it had much of a kick.   The salad was our favorite, served cooked, which was a surprise.  We would have shared a slice of honey cake for dessert but they were out of it.  The decor is cosy, with the ceiling meant to evoke a yurt and Asian-design wall hangings.     By the time we left at 8:30, the place was nearly full.  Most of the patrons appeared to be  of Asian descent, so the food must be pretty authentic.  We thought it was a worthwhile  experience.

That means there are dishes that are Slavic (like the borscht, which had...a broth redolent with flavor, meat, veggies, and a dollop of sour cream and bits sauce of fresh dill). Some are found in western china (like the Langan, which is a hand-pulled noodle with different kinds of sauces available). There are also really delicious salads--eg, avocado salad has chunks of avocado, chunks of tomato, cucumber, dill--a very very distant cousin of guacamole. Tandoor chicken was succulent and flavorful, can't say exactly what it was flavored with; not like Indian tandoor...more a marinated flavor.   Wait staff is sweet beyond belief. It takes a bit of patience to explain what you want sometimes. Seems like many many more of the patrons are from Kurdistan, and there will be families with young kids, young guys being with other young guys, and not too many ordinary Chicagoans.

Their website had photos of the dishes on the menu.  The three of us decided to try it.  On a bitterly cold winter night we found street parking right in...front of the restaurant.  There were only a few occupied tables at 6:30 pm but they were doing a good takeout business from a window facing the kitchen.  It was fortunate we had studied the menu because our waitress had little English, being a recent arrival from Kazakhstan.  We ordered the big plate of assorted traditional dishes which featured several types of dumplings, a shredded cabbage dish, plov, lagman noodles with beef, and a couple other items to sample as much as possible.  We also had ""Jibek Jolu special"" salad, a dish of plov (a rice dish flavored with meat and veggies) and lagman with lamb  (hand-pulled noodles with a separate tomato-ey, vinegary sauce).    The food came quickly.  It was a plentiful amount, quite tasty and filling.  It was not at all spicy, altho there was a small glass condiment jar of ground red chilis on the table to spice up the dishes, if desired.  I tried it but didn't think it had much of a kick.   The salad was our favorite, served cooked, which was a surprise.  We would have shared a slice of honey cake for dessert but they were out of it.  The decor is cosy, with the ceiling meant to evoke a yurt and Asian-design wall hangings.     By the time we left at 8:30, the place was nearly full.  Most of the patrons appeared to be  of Asian descent, so the food must be pretty authentic.  We thought it was a worthwhile  experience.  Go with several people, get a variety of dishes and share them.More"

We ordered the strawberry...Pannenkoeken which was excellent. I tried the ginger raisin Pannenkoeken. In my opinion it was way too sweet but I did enjoy the raisins in the pancake. I wish they had a raisin apple combo. We also ordered the cinnamon raisin French toast. It was as close to the flavor of a cinnamon roll and it was delicious. We also ordered the breakfast sandwich. Delicious. Definitely get the pork sausage for the best sandwich.  Pro Tip: It’s cash only so make sure to bring cash and if you forget don’t fret, a Chase is right around the corner.More"

Traditional American breakfasts are served, but I'v been there 10 times and I'm still working my way thru the Dutch dishes. It is truly small and especially on the weekends you will most likely have to wait to get in (consistent with their hospitality 5 or 6 chairs are made available to make the waiting time easier to take) They are open ever day except Tuesday and lunch is served as well but so far I haven't turned the menu over to look at the lunch offerings!More"

But You May Have to Wait.,"Food is Aces, Staff are also Aces, one drawback is just the size of the place. Normally, I do think that smaller spaces make it more intimate which is why it has been my go-to ""Morning after brunch date"" place in Lincoln Square. The food...is light enough and the coffee is well made. However, as it got more and more popular over the years (A Good Thing for the Business), you would often be put on a waiting list as the space can only accommodate so many diners at once. They do take your number and contact you once you're up. I usually use the long-ish waiting time to browse around the shops at Lincoln Square. So it's not that much of a con for me. But if you are starving or can't stand waiting, you may just want to go some place else. They don't take reservation so you have to go in to be put on the waiting list. Having said that, The food is authentic, unique, and deliciously light! Hope this Helps!More"

I was not impressed by the overall atmosphere and property. The service was just so so. The food was delivered quickly once we were actually waited on. They bring out numerous side dishes but don't ever refill them or even offer. The meats were brought out quickly and they did do a good job of trading out the grill as it got dirty. We had to chase them down to get water refills and a check. Probably won't be returning any time soon.Parking is very limited here too.

The atmosphere is average but pretty outdated. The parking is at a premium at this location. The wait staff is very inattentive for the majority of the evening. The service provided by the staff is good as far as taking care of replacing the grills as needed. The meats are fresh and they do bring them out fairly quickly. If you are used to the Korean format of getting numerous side dishes you won't be disappointed as they bring out numerous ones. But I'm used to having them refilled/replaced which doesn't happen here. They don't even ask if you want more. I will find others to visit.

Menu does NOT specify that the special deal for groups are 30 per person, wouldn’t have minded paying for it if they didn’t charge us for an extra person who did not even eat any of it. On top of that, they forced 18% gratuity AFTER tax, which is not only illegal but added almost $100 extra to our bill (223 before tax, 247 after tax, and 292 + tip AFTER TAX). Extremely disappointed in the management for ripping us off like this. We did talk to the manager and tell him that you cannot charge tip after tax, but I don’t think he understood English well and he was trying to rush us out of the restaurant. Very upset with how this was handled. Talking to our credit company to try and stop the illegal charge, but who knows what will happen. Definitely not coming here again.

Located at...4632 North Rockwell in the Lincoln Square/Ravenswood neighborhood, it is a kid-friendly local pub with craft beers, burgers and bar food in a tavern space with TVs and a patio. You can't get more homespun than that. There is so  much to choose from. Start with nachos or chips and salsa or cheddar fries or Louisiana egg rolls or a bowl of chicken tortilla soup. Add a Classic Caesar salad or a chopped chicken salad or a taco salad or just plain mixed greens. For the main course, choose a hot turkey sandwich or BBQ bacon burger or chicken strips or a 9-ounce pork chop or a burrito or a marinated skirt steak or a pork shoulder sandwich or 1/2-pound of Certified Angus beef with pepperjack cheese, grilled jalapeno and onion or spicy buffalo sauce and bleu cheese or home-made bacon jam and cheddar. How about The Big Ollie? If you've got an enormous appetite, this is the challenge of a lifetime--two 1/2-pound beef patties, each topped with Swiss and American cheese, Applewood smoked bacon, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle and Rockwell's signature sauce. Or, if you aren't so ambitious, build your own burger. Choose the meat, bun, cheese, condiments, spices, sauce and other extras. And don't forget the sides...fries, cole slaw, baked potato, rice, black beans, sauteed corn or mac 'n cheese. You won't go away hungry.

Our favorites were the mandrake - a radish in edible soil with cultured butter on the bottom; the pasties, one of peas, one of pastrami, and lamb in a tiny cast iron skillet; a spiny lobster disk with saffron; a porridge with chicken stock (Chef told me how they get such a deep flavor - they reduce it); and we ended with her take on butter beer - an oat ginger cake with butterscotch and white chocolate.

I went there with my husband for the Pagan Fire menu in July, to celebrate my new job....The restaurant is small but nicely decorated, the food was ok (flavors were a little underwhelming), the presentation was good but the portions very tiny.  I understand that that you don't get abnormally huge portions at restaurans like this, and that's how it should be.  HOWEVER, I don't think you're supposed to leave hungry either. Like I said, I've been to plenty of restaurants with Michelin stars and not once have I still felt hungy afterwards.   For example I've had a 5 course meal at one of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants (Maze, in NY) and I was full, maybe even too full.  We had a 6 courses at the Elizabeth and  actually had to eat something small at home afterwards because we were still hungry!  We weren't very thrilled about the wine pairing either.

Salt was sadly lacking and every dish seemed to come with ""sorrel from our roof top garden"", talk about a sorrel overload.  The wine pairing was decent but we didn't have a clue what we were drinking as the lady that served the wine was completely incoherent between her mumbling and speed talking. It became a running joke as the evening went on, placing bets on whether or not we would understand anything she said.  However, our waitress was good and service was well paced.

Fortunately, the...choice turned out to be a very good one. The service was fast and friendly, the menu choices plentiful, and the food was served hot and fresh. I opted for the chicken tenders, and when I tried to order cheese fries, the waitress told me they came with fries, thus saving me a little money. (I paid extra for the cheese, and I'm glad I did, even if the fries were a little on the crispy side - a bit overdone, but still very much edible.) She even apologized that the plate didn't come with a second BBQ sauce I had requested, but I told her not to bother getting it, because the amount served was more than adequate.  The only real negative was that it tends to get quite loud indoors - but seeing I was going to a concert, I don't think I have the right to complain about noise.

It was 14...degrees outside last night, and we were hoping to enjoy some comfort food on a cold Saturday evening.  The first challenge was getting inside the restaurant, as the door on the south entrance was locked.  We entered through the west door and stood in the front of the restaurant for a few minutes before being seated.  While there was only one or two tables filled at Jerry's, the host did not ask us where we would like to sit but rather put us next to a large table with a couple of young children.  We chose another table across the room, and five minutes later another group was seated right next to us even though there were many other open tables.  I had to borrow a napkin from the adjacent table, as our table had not been properly wiped down.    The waiter (who was also the host and bartender) brought us two menus and two small glasses of water, and quitely walked away.  The water was quickly finished, and only refilled upon request after a bit of a delay.  We came across the daily specials menu at our table, but none were highlighted or shared when we ordered our meals.  I ordered the half-sandwich and soup combo, and was told that the sandwich I ordered could not be included in the combo.  I ended up having a skirt steak sandwich and gumbo with a side of sweet potatoes.  I have to say that the overall quality of the food was not an issue, as the sandwich was delicious with excellent and unique toppings, the gumbo was tasty with just the right amount of spice, and the sweet potatoes were very well done.  The challenge with the half sandwich was the rather small size, and the side serving was gone in a few bites.  Unfortunately, the gumbo was warm at best, which was disappointing on a cold Chicago night. For a $15 sandwich meal (plus tax and tip), I had higher expectations.  My wife ordered a breaded BBQ chicken sandwich with a side salad and a side of sweet potatoes ($14.50).  She enjoyed her meal, as the sandwich was delicious and the side salad with vinagrette dressing was quite tasty.  In fact, she could not finish her meal and brought the rest home.  The waiter brought the check in a timely fashion, but did not ask if we would like dessert.  In fairness, there was alot to like about Jerry's in terms of interesting decor, ample beer and sandwich selections, numerous flat screen televisions, and of course the centralized location in Lincoln Square.  However, it was tough to get past the poor service, small portion sizes, and relatively high prices for sandwiches at Jerry's.More"

Cozy and comfortable, it makes everyone feel welcome. The staff is terrific and Chef Vittorio is jolly and friendly. Food is Roman style, I guess. The pizzas are terrific and amply sized, with medium crust. Recently they have offered a thin crust circular pizza that is perfect. Most of the pasta is house made. I recommend the tagliatelle bolognese; it's absolutely delicious. But even the basic spaghetti and meatballs is an excellent dish. I Monelli doesn't have a liquor license, so it's BYOB, making the place even more affordable. (There is a liquor store across the street, however.) Can't say enough about this place. It's down to earth, friendly, and serves great Italian comfort food. Carry out is also quick and efficient. The place can get filled up on Friday and Saturday nights, but if you like to dine before 7:00, you can usually get a table. It's always good to make a reservation, just in case. Week nights are often free and clear. Go by yourself, with a significant other, or group of friends. You won't be disappointed.More"

The dish was taken back, but she was not satisfied with the warmed up attempt with the dish.  As a result, she did not eat.   The most troubling thing was that the waitstaff/management did not seem to care.   They offered to take 10% of the bill to which I told them that was not acceptable and that the one dish should be removed from the bill.   They removed it from the bill and offered to get something else, but we did not want to risk it taking another hour to get a meal.   Furthermore, it looked as though nobody else was getting food.

I Monelli,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g35805-d1107149-Reviews-I_Monelli-Chicago_Illinois.html,"February 8, 2016",5,Motto bene (Very good),"We have been going to I Monelli for years, probably once a month, and we have never had a bad experience. It is truly a hidden gem and a neighborhood treasure. We like it because it's easy to get to from the north suburbs and...it has a decidedly unpretentious air about it. Cozy and comfortable, it makes everyone feel welcome. The staff is terrific and Chef Vittorio is jolly and friendly. Food is Roman style, I guess. The pizzas are terrific and amply sized, with medium crust. Recently they have offered a thin crust circular pizza that is perfect. Most of the pasta is house made. I recommend the tagliatelle bolognese; it's absolutely delicious. But even the basic spaghetti and meatballs is an excellent dish. I Monelli doesn't have a liquor license, so it's BYOB, making the place even more affordable. (There is a liquor store across the street, however.) Can't say enough about this place. It's down to earth, friendly, and serves great Italian comfort food. Carry out is also quick and efficient. The place can get filled up on Friday and Saturday nights, but if you like to dine before 7:00, you can usually get a table. It's always good to make a reservation, just in case. Week nights are often free and clear. Go by yourself, with a significant other, or group of friends. You won't be disappointed.More"

I had dinner there tonight and, as a result of my experience, would not recommend it.   It took almost an hour to get our meals (nothing complicated - chicken/pasta...dishes)  and one of my dining companions complained that her chicken was tough and the vegetables were cold.   The dish was taken back, but she was not satisfied with the warmed up attempt with the dish.  As a result, she did not eat.   The most troubling thing was that the waitstaff/management did not seem to care.   They offered to take 10% of the bill to which I told them that was not acceptable and that the one dish should be removed from the bill.   They removed it from the bill and offered to get something else, but we did not want to risk it taking another hour to get a meal.   Furthermore, it looked as though nobody else was getting food.   My dish was okay, but there was no excuse for this as the restaurant was not filled.    I cannot recommend this restaurant and was embarassed by this place as I recommended it and this was the first time my companions ate there.More"

My particular favorite (after 3 visits) is the gnocchi.  Not quiet, but not loud; no need to shout across the table to have a conversation. Would serve for a low-key romantic dinner. Each of the times we've been there, the other couples were also pleased and have since gone back.  I'm really impressed with the consistency - each of our 3 visits were without any disappointments.

I have a dull Madras elsewhere and nothing compares to this place. I have discovered this place from my close friend who took me here two years ago and you should get a lot for not too much money dining out.

I ended up getting the lamb shank chops cooled medium well with rice baked potato and peas on the side. Very delicious. I am ending my meal with baklava for dessert.

Everyone in there was Greek. The food was inexpensive and it showed. For such a prime location it was DEAD at 7PM on a Saturday night. We walked...by just while talking a walk. The rain had stopped. Lincoln Square is a nice place for a walk on a winter evening - lots to look at and several stores still open because of Holiday shoppers! So we decide to go in. The entire restaurant is empty and dark except the front six tables. They were up on a floor next to the window. The rest of the place literally had the lights off. The bar only serves beer and wine - or it might serve more but the menu only lists beer and wine. We had kids with us so we didn't sit at the bar. There was no wait. We were greeted immediately. The prices were the first to catch my eye. Second was they had ""specials"" for a Saturday. That should have told me something but occasionally I like to be optimistic. We started with the Saganaki. Our waiter ordered it and brought it right out. We told our son, ""look"" but before he looked up it was over. There was literally no ""presentation"". Our waiter almost looked embarrassed. I saw two other servers do this two more times. There was no presentation. How sad. Isn't that part of the flaming cheese? The ""opas"" were barely audible  and almost apologetic. But the cheese and bread were fantastic. We also had a greek salad - generous helpings of feta but maybe two olives. The tomatoes were mealy but that's only Chicago in winter, probably couldn't be helped... For dinner our son ordered a pasta dish that was supposedly served with browned butter and a greek cheese. It was mushy tastely spaghetti with some parmesan. It tasted oily. It wasn't good. It was in bad need of salt. The pasta was so overcooked it barely had texture. I ordered the Lamb special with artichokes in a lemon sauce. Well I got a soup bowl with a marvelous lamb shank drowning in the lemon sauce and four large artichokes. The lamb was good but there was way too much sauce. It was slightly nauseating. It was thick and glopy. It didn't taste bad. The menu didn't describe it as if my lamb would be drowning. My husband got the BBQ lamb ""back"". he had to ask, ""what part is the ""back"" and the server said, ""it's like ribs"" but there was no bone. It was just dry lamb. It had a nice taste but it was super dry. It came with rice and peas. Overall we were underwhelmed. Our server was very nice and attentive. As we were leaving the place started to fill so they turned on some lights. They had three big parties - 8 or more people. I probably wouldn't try it again or I'd stay away from ""specials"". We were going to get saganaki and gyros but the Lamb specials seemed like such great deals since all other lamb on the menu was twice the price. Now we know why...More"

The serving was quite large, and was accompanied with a nice serving...of rosted green peas and a small potato. We passed up on many other awesome menu offerings to take advantage of the daily special. Bread (albeit somewhat dry) and olive oil for dipping was included. Also included was the choice of 2 soups. We has the split pea and it was fabulous. We also ordered the house greek wine. It was good, and it has a unique pine undertone and nose. And it is described that way, so no suprise. A glsss will take you through the meal.   The Restaurant is just a very short walk off of the easily accessible CTA Brown line at the ""Western stop"" (direction: Kimball). It's about 12 - 15 stops out from ""central city"" and located in beautiful Lincoln Square. (NOT Lincoln Park). The street and area is lined with shops, and a host of other ethnic restaurants, all of which looked very interesting as well.   The restaurant was very clean, it had quite an appealing and authentic feel, including the staff. Its worth the CTA ride out just to explore the area and then have dinner. I enjoyed the feel of the restuarant as well as the entire neighborhood. The prices were very reasonable, and the portions were Chicago- sized. It seems they have a small dance floor and band stand, but no entertainment on the night of our visit. In fact an artist was painting the Chagal inspired mural behing the band area.   There are several different sections in the restaurant for seating, yet it's not a huge. restaurant. The bar area was attractive, and there were street-front windows, with high top tables located there, as well as bar seating.   Just hop on the CTA brown line toward Kimball, and discover a great neighborhood area of Chicago outside of the normal Michigan Avenue / State Street strip. You will be glad you did.More"

Only one other person was eating in the restaurant at this time. The restaurant has a cute design. I ordered a Neapolitan anti pasta—polenta with ragu sauce which was homemade and delicious. I inquired whether the...pastas are all home made and the waiter said no. Only 1 or 2 of many pastas on the menu and specials list are homemade including lasagna which is strange for an Italian restaurant. Is it too much to ask for an Italian restaurant to make fresh pasta? For my 2nd dish I ordered the Italian Festivo which was on the special list which was freshly made and inckyddd a meatball, manicotti, Italian sausage and something else in a light red cream sauce which was ok. The price point for this restaurant on Wilson Ave west of Uptown is too high for this neighborhood. These prices you would find downtown. $12 for an anti pasta and $22.95 for all pastas (including those not made fresh) is a bit steep. Additionally, as other reviewers have stated, the restaurant serves stale Italian bread which makes no sense except a desire to cut corners—it would be better to serve no bread if it isn’t going to be fresh. I had no problem with the restaurant not serving alcohol but the greatest problem is the lack of parking. Parker’s beware that most residential streets surrounding the restaurant have permit parking all day. There are much better choices for Italian food—Calo, Spacca Napoli (a block away from Caro Mio), Anna Maria Pasteria, Topo Gigio, Italian Village and on and on—and all these restaurants sell alcohol.More"

Sensing that we were not familiar with Bosnian cuisine, the waiter offered to create a large and varied plate for the remainder of the party which was comprised of several different menu offerings.

I really wanted it to be delicious. I read some reviews and had hoped for the best. This business, Jimmy's Pizza Cafe, does offer a 10% military/police discount which about covers the enormous...tax rate in Chicago. I spoke with a pleasant enough woman on the phone while ordering it. She told me that the crust was hand made and that the fresh mozzarella was delicious. So what did I do? I chose sliced tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, spinach, chicken and it came with some of the usual sauce and shredded mozzarella that pizzas tend to come with. The pizza with delivery ($3) plus the tip ($3.20) cost $45.00 (with the 10% discount applied already). I opened the enormous box. The visual presentation was pleasant enough. I slipped two pieces onto a blue ceramic plate, hunkered down in front of a movie and eagerly took a bite hoping for a super satisfying taste to wash over my taste buds... It was so bland. So very very bland. Nearly tasteless. I chomped into the somewhat tough and overly chewy ""handmade"" crust. It was utterly dissatisfying! I was so hungry and so desirous of some good pizza. I am originally from NY and I have had some excellent, excellent pizza in my life. This was just not it. Not at all. I managed to slog down two slices, as I was totally famished, and I was so unhappy. The chicken was in small 3/4"" x 3/4"" x 3/16"" squares and they were so dry. Not fund to chew or eat at all! There seemed to be no seasoning not any sort of noticable "" pizza"" zest to it at all. I dusted it with some black pepper I. Hopes that it would assist the blatant blandness. To no avail. Even the crust edge was unpleasant to try and chomp, chew through. I will not get another expensive and tasteless pizza from there again. Sorry. I would much rather write a pleasant review but my experience with this bland and tasteless oversized disc has left me without the words and experience I had hoped to have had... If you opt to try this pizza from this business, I certainly hope you have a better experience. Good luck!More"

Health Code WARNING,"I just ordered Jimmy's pizza and this will be the last. After waiting an hour, typical for Chicago, our delivery arrived. My girlfriend had opened the box and picked up a slice, only for me to realize that we received the wrong pizza! I called...the store back and spoke with their manager Jimmy, whom did not apologize and said the driver would be back to give us the right pizza. When the driver arrived, he asked for the wrong pizza back. When we told him that we touched the pizza he explained, ""Well, we need the pizza back as the store is far away and I need to deliver that pizza as it is close by."" We then repeated that we TOUCHED the pizza, and he continued saying he needed to deliver that pizza. We reluctantly gave the pizza back as we couldn't believe this was happening. I asked for the manager to call me back, he never did, so I called the store back to speak with Jimmy about the matter. I asked him if it was his policy that when a mistake was delivered to take back the order and try to re-deliver it. He said that the pizza wasn't delivered. When I told him that the driver literally told me that he needed the pizza back so he could deliver the pizza, he then raised his voice yelling at me to not accuse him and that he'd take a picture of the pizza if I needed proof. I proceeded to explain that I do not believe him as I'm sure a pizzeria has other pizzas and I'm only taking them at their word. He then got very upset and said ""I'm done with this"" and hung up. Instead of being apologetic and trying to remedy the situation, he only escalated the already disgusting situation, with horrific customer service. The pizza was luke-warm, if not cool to begin with, but fine otherwise. The garlic knots were sub-par. So if you're looking to spend $60 for average pizza that's slightly cool, being insulted, and with a topping of possible 2nd-hand pizza, this is the place for you.More"

I visited long time ago Aroy and I loved it but then we didn't come back until recently. My second visit was just like the first one, perfect. I absolutely...love this cozy restaurant near the brown line station. The staff are super friendly but the food its AMAZING. I ordered a papaya salad and some spicy beef with vegetable and my hubby some noddle soup and we couldn't literally walk, we were extremely full. I love the fact they are very tradition and less Americanize so food its very authentic Thai. on top of food been delicious they have 2 great perks; first if you pay with cash they give you a discount and  second they are BYOB which its always A+. Only I will suggest its that they might have to change the rug soon cause it smells a little funny near the windows tables. Other than this hands down one of the best Thai restaurant in Chicago and for me the best in Ravenswood.More"

Although, last week I made the mistake to...order the lunch special Panang curry and about a half a cup of curry were served on two cups of rice. It totally ruined the dish that normally is served separate, rice on the side. I was disappointed Aroy Thai cutting corners so therefore 4 stars. Everything else I ordered has been great. Suggestion: train the waitress in describing and recommending the several dishes in the extensive menu, besides curry and pad Thai. Give samples of unusual dishes we don't know. Add sauces to your condiments tray.More"

This is a small neighborhood restaurant with about 8 tables in one room and 4 in the other.   We started with the Sausage Combination of...Isaan and Sai Ina sausage. I'm not a sausage person but this had been recommended by a reviewer. There were two types of sausage. The Isaan was milder and somewhat boring but the other was spicy and I liked it better. It was a little dry and I would have liked a sauce or mustard with it.   We opted for the lunch special. The crab Rangoon was very tasty. I had the red curry. I usually get a yellow curry at my local Thai restaurant but they didn't have yellow curry. The red curry was OK but nothing outstanding. They served it over rice instead of rice on the side and that diluted the good curry flavor. My friend liked her Pad Woon Sen Noodles.   We have several good Thai restaurants in our area and I'm not sure I would return to this one.More"

Aroy Thai is one of that few - this place is among the very best. The menu is larger and more varied than most, with a wider range of choices...in every area - appetizer, soups, and main courses.  The ingredients are always fresh, and never taste as if they have been prepared long ago and just been microwaved when you order. They seem freshly prepared. And the spice content is not dumbed down for American taste. If you ask them to make it a bit more mild they will - but if you tell them that you enjoy spicy food, you'll get authentic heat. The black crab salad was extraordinarily flavorful, and quite spicy - though the black crabs gave up their meat reluctantly, and were a bit more work than I would be willing to put in again. Still, overall the salad was a treat. Even moreso was the beef in a spicy ginger sauce, with perfectly cooked green beans accompanying.  We will be coming back many times.  Service was friendly and efficient, and the price point was low ($30 for dinner for two, including appetizer). BYOB.More"

Well..because it's SUSHI HAPPY...HOUR Monday through Friday at these times and so cocktails and all their maki rolls are half off so it's a bargain to eat here at these times and every sushi roll I try never disappoints. I love their spicy Octopus roll, salmon rolls, tuna rolls, vegetarian based rolls and everything is so clean tasting with great presentation.  If you aren't a fan of tables of families with children then choose a different hour because the half off happy hour is the busiest time and usually single mothers with their children or all the parents will be here.

Lincoln Avenue.   First thing to know it that this is street parking on Lincoln Avenue... no free parking. You...will need to get a parking sticker from one of the machines to put on your dashboard.   When we arrived there was no one else in the restaurant. Fortunately several more people came in and a few orders were picked up for takeout.  From what I understand Taco in a Bag is basically high end nachos with all of the ingredients placed in a bag. They have about 8 options for the taco in a bag. They have names like the ""Big Jim Reeves, Cheeseburger Nachos, The Norberto, The Angry Bird"" etc.  Some of the meat ingredients are chorizo, ground beef, chicken thighs, and more. They even have gluten free and a few vegetarian options. They also have Salads in a Bag and some dessert options.   I only gave this an average because it seemed that there were more corn chips in the bag than anything else. The other ingredients when I found them were good, but the major ingredient were the nacho chips.  We also had the Donuts in a Bag for dessert. These took several minutes to prepare. We had the Nutella donuts. When they arrived there was a big glob of whipped cream over the 5 donut holes. Wish I had known that. Since the donuts were hot the whipped cream started to melt and make a soupy mess. There was a drizzle of Nutella over the hot donuts, but it tasted more like chocolate sauce.  The interior of the restaurant looked like it was straight out of the Aqua teen hunger force cartoon. They only serve soft drinks and I do not know if it's a BYOB or not. When we were there we did not see anyone with any adult beverages.  I can now say I have been to Taco in a Bag on Lincoln Avenue, but I won't be in any rush to return.More"

Thai restaurants are ubiquitous in the city, thus the competition must be strong.  Compared to similar spots, however, the offerings were somewhat limited.

The first was the baby egg rolls which was six smaller egg rolls filled with ground shrimp & chicken with a tasty sweet & sour dipping sauce.  We also ordered a seaweed salad which was on chilled cucumbers with a sweet & sour vinaigrette.  Our entree was the special Pad Thai.which was stir-fried glass (bean) noodles, egg, green onion, bean sprouts, crushed peanuts and lime with chicken and two shrimp.

I didn't expect the chicken to be cold. Blackened chicken would have made this salad so much better. Overall, our food was adequate -- not particulaly outstanding or special.  Prices seemed to be a little too high for what we received.  Wine prices were way out of line so we skipped the wine. I do think it's nice that the restaurant is attached to a theater.

Officially titled Baker Miller Bakery & Dinette, a combination café and mill house from former Bang Bang Pie employees that debuted in 2014, much of the Miller’s early praise came from house-ground Grains, hand-milled Flour and Chicago’s first “Toast Bar,” while critiques of both price and inconsistency have also been commonplace.  Using online or walk-up ordering during COVID-19, staff appropriately donning PPE but inattentive-bordering-on-rude while waiting for two slices of Bread to be toasted, it was on a nearby bench that the Miller’s goods were eaten, buttered naturally-leavened Sourdough an immediate highlight thanks to both tanginess and crumb while a $3.75 Biscuit was arguably underbaked at the bottom but nonetheless enjoyable.   Trying hard not to focus on prices, David and Megan’s commitment to their craft most certainly commendable, it is hard not to raise an eyebrow at $3.50 for a two-bite Sandwich Cookie that tastes mostly like Sugar, a quarter more for double the amount of Chocolate Chips and perfectly baked Dough faring far better in terms of taste as well as value.  Also performing well with a toothsome Thumbprint Cookie, Strawberry Jam providing just enough sweetness to a blend of Nuts and Oats, those seeking a “signature” item will find it in Baker Miller’s “Doughboy,” the baked round far lighter than a Doughnut and currently dressed like Cinnamon Toast Crunch Cereal clocking in at $4.50 after tax – far better than the more expensive Blueberry Oat Muffin which finds Fruit in a clump at the center of an otherwise flavorless matrix.More"

An interesting idea is a toaster at every table, along with a small table of jams, jellies and butters.  We ordered the Ben Biscuit and we also ordered the Southern Hash.  Both were tasty.  The prices are a bit high, but the food quality was very good.  The portions were ample, in fact, we took half of the Ben Biscuit and half of the Southern Hash home.

Food cooked properly but not brimming with flavor.,"Went for a late afternoon lunch during what I always called ""the lull"".. you know, that time between lunch and dinner where everything is not hectic and the place isn't packed to the gills with a lunch crowd or the early-birds for dinner.  Well, no...host was on, this can kind of be expected for late lunch. The bar was also closed so, no help there. Started walking in and a nice lady asked us to pick any seat we wanted, which we did. The place had maybe four other tables seated.  Waited about three minutes and a lady rushed by dropping off menus, no greeting or hellos.  Waited around for another three-to-five minutes and a lady came by with waters and salsa.  ...another five or so minutes and our waitress came by for our drink order. Knowing this was not going to be the fastest service otherwise, we also ordered food. Her demeanor was pleasant.  So, if this were a normal dinner service in a packed house, these kind of wait times would kind of make sense. But this was a meal during the slowest part of the day where there are people scrounging for work to be done - and I know this because A- I'm observant, and B- I've been working in front of house for 20+ years.  Food got there in another ten mintues (kitchen was on time at least), but then after we were obviously done with our food another fifteen minutes to get the check and another five to resolve it!  Please note, when I say 'obviously done' what I mean is: plates are stacked, napkins piled up in the empty tortilla chip basket. glasses are emptied, all used tableware is sitting on the side of the table to be bussed... we sat like that for those fifteen minutes, trying to make eye contact. One other table had walked in during our visit. they had three servers on. ...Or two and a busser, I'm not completely sure. The water/salsa lady only came by once, and we had to ask for refills on the water when the drinks were brought over.  Service gets a one. I'm sorry Garcia's, you got to step your game up.  The food - the food was, in general, good. Not Very Good, not Average.   The salsa seemed like it was made with a good recipe, a little too much cilantro for my liking but tasty. The chips were hearty and did not easily break. This was the highlight of the meal.  We both ordered a burrito. One al Pastor for me (yay, pork!), one Picadillo, add cheese for the lady. The burritos were standard in sizing, and wrapped well (AKA did not fall apart). The tortillas were thick enough not to rip, but thin enough to not feel like a mouth full of tortilla dough on each bite. The flavors were... OK. Maybe the little bit of heat from the salsa was killing off any hidden, subdued flavors in that meat but I doubt it. My pork had a good combination of texture and it was made right, there was just very little to write home about in the flavor zone. Yes it was pork. Yes it was cooked properly. Yes it was built right. No, it did nothing to make me want to go back and order another one. My lady felt the same about her ground beef.    So, as I said, good? Yes, Very good, no. Average? Probably, but I would like to think it was just an off day. 3.5 out of 5. because the salsa was on point.  Pricing: Good for what you get, I suppose, if you're ignoring the near-blandness of the food. three out of five. We both had an imported 12 oz beer at $4.50 each,  domestic bottles were $3.50. The whole shebang was under $30. Kind of pricey for lunch, but at least the burritos were a good size.  Overall two out of five. I wish I could call this experience ""average""... but those were some damned long wait times for food that was just a bit above average. As mentioned beforehand, maybe it was an off-day at Garcia's. I would like to try them again for dinner, maybe some of those famous margaritas they are known for would make a dinner service more enjoyable.More"

Most recently we dined at Sushi Tokoro which is located just north of the El on Western Ave. Overall, the restaurant staff was prompt, friendly and responded very...quickly to our requests. There are 2 choices for dining: ordering off the menu or $22 for all you can eat. We choose the $22. It was the day after Christmas, December 26th and we were surprised to find the restaurant at almost 95% capacity with several additional hungry diners picking up carry out. We ordered 8 rolls for 2 people which voila, it came displayed on ""the Boat"". I know it's cheezy but, I love it when Sushi arrives on a bamboo boat. This one filled up the empty space with a plastic fish decor, cute ;). The rolls were filling but, had a little too much rice, making them hard to eat in one bite. Even though we had 8 different kinds of rolls, they all tasted very similar. We think it's because on the flat fee. For the price and good service, we would go back but, the food quality is only so-so. A few notes: There is parking on the street, just make sure you pay at the green box, otherwise Chicago will ticket you. Public transportation is available, Brown Line and CTA.

You can find paid street parking fairly easy later in the evening, but maybe not during the day because this area does get a lot of traffic....The Western (#49) and Lawrence (#81) buses do run very frequently. It is also very close to the Western Brown line station.   We came on a weekday to have the all-you-can-eat sushi. The restaurant is clean and modern with a touch of pop from the band of light that runs horizontally across the middle of the wall that changes color. They have plenty of tables in addition to the prime seating where diners can watch the sushi chefs perform their magic. You can choose to order from the regular menu a la carte or from the special ayce menu. The sushi is better than average. Very fresh. Not padded with a lot of rice. Most of the hot items were good, but the fried items were a little cold like they have been sitting out for a while. This also reflected on the sushi rolls that contained fried shrimp or soft-shelled crab. Otherwise, most of the nigiri and maki were very tasty. If you order enough sushi, they will present it on a boat or bridge beautifully decorated. Be sure to finish what you order because they can charge you for what you don't finish. Service was very good. Servers were very polite and attentive. And the restaurant is BYOB.More"

TripAdvisor recommendations win out again!  The restaurant is in a little strip mall in a very unassuming location.  If you...are looking for a fancier place for a more formal occasion, this is not the restaurant for you, but if you want a friendly welcoming atmosphere for almost any other kind of more relaxed occasion, even a nice informal date, then this place is wonderful. The restaurant is quite small, and while we went in and got a table (without a reservation) it looked like about half of the restaurant tables were already reserved, and several groups that came in while we were there all had made reservations.  So, I would suggest making reservations ahead of time just to make sure you get a table.  Everyone who came in, regardless of reservation, was greeted by a staff that was one of the most down to earth and friendly that I have exer experienced at an Indian restaurant.  They really made you feel at home. While the decorations in the restaurant were nice, the restaurants location makes it seem like quite a hole in the wall - but it was wel worth it.  On to the food!  My wife and I started with some of their Mulligatawny soup which was truly superb.  It was filled with all sorts of vegetables - zucchini, eggplant, broccoli, peas, lentils - with a wonderful consistency in which the pieces were neither too large (sometimes these types of soups can seem more like a stew) or too small, so the soup had a wonderful mixture of flavors along with a great texture.  We also had the cucumber yoghurt salad on the side - very flavorful - with the crispy flatbread that is served to everyone with three great chutneys (sweet, spicy, and cilantro).  For our main courses we had a vegetable dish of spiced potatoes and cauliflower, along with their tandoor chicken.  Both were really great.  The chicken was tender and flavorful and the vegetable dish had nice pieces of all the vegetables in a well seasoned curry sauce.  The disshes were served with a wonderful spiced basmati rice that was mixed with shredded carrots.  We are ready to go back anytime, and are anxious to try out some of their other dishes.  We were so full we didn't get to try out any of their desserts which also looked tempting.  I should also note that the restaurant is BYOB.  However, in contrast to a number of other restaurants where you might feel a little uncomfortable bringing in wine or they have a large corkage fee, here they are again very welcoming.  They had wine bottle openers already placed on a lot of tables, making you feel at home to bring your bottle and open it whenever you please.  Overall, it is a great place!

I have no idea what the food tastes like but I can offer my opinion that their service is horrible.   I placed an order 2 hours ago.  When I placed the...order, I was told to expect delivery in 40 minutes.  After waiting for 50 minutes, I called the restaurant.  A woman answered.  She said the driver left 10 minutes ago and I should expect my food in a few minutes. After waiting another 20 minutes (over an hour after I placed the order), I called back again.  I spoke to a man.  He said that the delivery guy just left 10 minutes ago and he should be there any minute.  He claimed he had no idea who I spoke with during my earlier call and he had no way of contacting the delivery person and giving me a more accurate estimate.  (Really? Ever heard of cell phones?)  At an hour and 40 minutes, I called the restaurant again and asked to speak to a manager.  I was told the manager was too busy to talk to me but I could leave a number and he would call me back.  I insisted and was put on hold for about 20 minutes.  I never did get to speak to a manager but when someone finally came back on the line, I told them to cancel the order and wished them a Happy New Year.  Obviously this business does not care about customers.  Seriously.  If your delivery time is 2 hours, just be honest.  I wouldn't have canceled the order if they had just been up front.  But lying to your customers is not a good idea.  Not to mention a manager who would rather put a customer on hold for 20 minutes, hoping they'll just give up and hang up, than getting on the line to accept responsibility for the restaurant's mistake.    Bottom line, if you don't want to starve, go elsewhere.  We did.  Ordered sushi from Fin.  It was delicious.

Located at 4530 North Lincoln Avenue in the Lincoln Park neighborhood that is festooned with very competitive restaurants, bars and grills, it has carved its...own niche with its definite Irish/English pub-type look. Inside, there is a long, narrow space that features booths along the wall, a long and elegant bar and a back room for overflow during busier times. Late 1960s and early 1970s classic British rock and roll plays in the background. Live music is featured Sunday through Wednesday with Irish music highlighted on Sunday evening. But the food is the thing. Grafton specializes in grilled chicken sandwich, smoked salmon BLT, Irish lamb stew and a traditional Shepherd's pie. But I prefer the Grafton burger with Black Angus choice beef and Swiss cheese or the grass-fed burger with American cheese, lettuce and tomato. A series of Irish bartenders serve expertly poured pints of Guinness in the traditional way--the two-minute pour. This technique consists of filling up your pint 3/4 of the way, letting it sit for about two minutes so that the initial pour can settle, then topping it off all the way to the top. And remember, Guinness is not meant to be served ice cold but rather 41 to 46 degrees Fahrenheit. The Grafton also serves up such British favorites as Bass, Newcastle, Boddingtons and Olde Speckled Hen and other local favorites such as Becks, Blue Moon, Stella Artois and Spaten. But we aren't beer drinkers. Ginger ale and Bergdorf root beer suit us just fine. We started with a selection of meat and cheeses and Buffalo chicken strips with blue cheese dressing. Then a bowl of chili, an order of fish and chips and a grass-fed burger with fries, topped off with a big slice of oven baked apple pie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, whipped cream and caramel sauce. I'm not Irish so I'll let the comparisons be made by Irishmen with more expertise and experience. But it's hard to believe there is a more entertaining Irish pub in Chicago.More"

I bit into my burger on Sunday and grease dripped down my arm into my lap and if that wasn't bad enough the patty itself was flavorless.

Located at 4530 North Lincoln Avenue in the Lincoln Park neighborhood that is festooned with very competitive restaurants, bars and grills, it has carved its...own niche with its definite Irish/English pub-type look. Inside, there is a long, narrow space that features booths along the wall, a long and elegant bar and a back room for overflow during busier times. Late 1960s and early 1970s classic British rock and roll plays in the background. Live music is featured Sunday through Wednesday with Irish music highlighted on Sunday evening. But the food is the thing. Grafton specializes in grilled chicken sandwich, smoked salmon BLT, Irish lamb stew and a traditional Shepherd's pie. But I prefer the Grafton burger with Black Angus choice beef and Swiss cheese or the grass-fed burger with American cheese, lettuce and tomato. A series of Irish bartenders serve expertly poured pints of Guinness in the traditional way--the two-minute pour. This technique consists of filling up your pint 3/4 of the way, letting it sit for about two minutes so that the initial pour can settle, then topping it off all the way to the top. And remember, Guinness is not meant to be served ice cold but rather 41 to 46 degrees Fahrenheit. The Grafton also serves up such British favorites as Bass, Newcastle, Boddingtons and Olde Speckled Hen and other local favorites such as Becks, Blue Moon, Stella Artois and Spaten. But we aren't beer drinkers. Ginger ale and Bergdorf root beer suit us just fine. We started with a selection of meat and cheeses and Buffalo chicken strips with blue cheese dressing. Then a bowl of chili, an order of fish and chips and a grass-fed burger with fries, topped off with a big slice of oven baked apple pie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, whipped cream and caramel sauce. I'm not Irish so I'll let the comparisons be made by Irishmen with more expertise and experience. But it's hard to believe there is a more entertaining Irish pub in Chicago.More"

The food was excellent, the service less. Taking into account that there were no other people, the food could have...been served better.

Spring rolls had that something off taste, which should've been a signal to leave. But, we were hungry. Another signal I ignored. No fresh Thai chillis... they just use the dry powder and seeds....Why would I think they would've had fresh? Next, the Chicken satay; since when is that deep fried? anywhere in the world? They were not grilled, but deep fried... in old oil... what a taste :-(  The Pad Kraprow / basil chicken and veg had about 7x the amount of onion in it then it should've... of course, limited volume on the more expensive veg... to one fair there was plenty of meat... But... Finally, the men's room was so smelly and dirty. I returned home with a compulsion to wash wash my hands over and over.  I wish I had not eaten any of it. We will not be going back. And, I write this to share with others to beware.More"

It’s across the street from my house, I go here a minimum of once a month.   Do not be turned off by the simplicity of it. They’re focused on the food, not on fancy word carvings to hang on the walls....I’ve tried several items from all sections of the menu. My personal favorite is the Massaman gai, but frankly that’s because it’s one of my favorite Thai dishes. My biggest complaint is that they’re easy on the spice, but I understand why.   Plus, they’re so nice here. Everyone is just really pleasant.   Eat Spoon Thai. Do it. Kop khun kah.More"

Dinner at this Thai restaurant turned out to be just average.The Papaya salad ( Som Tum) which is a Thai staple was definitely not made in...the traditional Thai style ( there was no ""TUM"" done to it) . The soft shelled crab was good. The Jasmine scented coconut ""pudding"" had NO Jasmine in it at all. The menu was so extensive that it was a bit overwhelming. The wait staff was friendly and courteous. The restaurant itself, on the small side, but nicely arranged - now decorated for Halloween. In summary, average American Thai food.  While none of the dishes that my party had were authentic, it is very possible that there are some hiding on the very extensive menu: reasonable pricing.More"

Thai sounded great or dinner especially since it seemed EVERY restaurant worth going to downtown was booked solid. Honestly I wasn't expecting much but Spoon Thai was fabulous!!!  The menu had...a lot to offer including the Americanized Thai food, Pad Thai, Pad See Eue, etc. but in the back of the menu were really authentic Thai dishes!!! We ordered one, the Thai sausage, as an appetizer and it was delicious! The yellow curry and the Ban Me pork noodles were also outrageous!   Considering I was disappointed about not going downtown I could not have been more pleased with where we ended up. The service wasn't the best but the food certainly made up for it.
