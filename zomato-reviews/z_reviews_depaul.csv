There are also these bite size items called pinxtos that are about $2 a piece but we tried all six for $11 because getting a little bit of everything is the way to go at a place like this.

Range Restaurant,https://www.zomato.com/chicago/range-lincoln-park/reviews,"Apr 03, 2015",4,"Range is a charming neighborhood restaurant in one of my favorite parts of Lincoln Park. The menu is comprised of rustic classics like roast chicken, skirt steak, and burgers. I recently got to attend a sampling of the winter menu and my friends and I were treated to six different selections from the new menu, each paired with a beer. Range’s Chef Luis is very conscious of what his restaurant is serving and his goal is to use locally and responsibly sourced ingredients. It is a farm to table approach that takes advantage of local producers. Range’s menu gives credit to their suppliers by listing their names and location on the menu. Our meal began with a duo of appetizers: Meatballs and Buffalo Cauliflower. The hearty meatballs were drown in a cherry-heirloom sauce and had a duck egg in the center. Meatballs as an appetizer are a bit of a trend these days in Chicago, I like meatballs, but think they are a little heavy for an appetizer. The meatballs were good, but the buffalo cauliflower was a showstopper. Cauliflower was covered in buffalo sauce and served with buttermilk blue cheese sauce. This was the dish that everyone wanted to learn how to recreate at home. Next we had a Russian Kale Salad. I really don’t like kale, but I ate every bite of this salad, and it was huge. I think everyone ate every bite of their salad. Apparently if you add apples, dried cranberries, Mona cheese, croutons, and a buttermilk dressing to kale, it turns into the best thing ever. Want a healthy dinner? Just get the buffalo cauliflower and a salad. Then we moved onto the entrees. We got to sample both the Skirt Steak and the Chicken. The skirt steak came with a side of shiitake ravioli and spinach and was drizzled with a stout sauce. The shiitake ravioli was made with fresh pasta and was loaded with meaty mushrooms. The chicken was rubbed with smoked pepper, and served with pickled veggies, roasted garlic, fingerling potatoes, and a horseradish root biscuit gravy. The chicken was another dish that got everyone talking. It was really fresh – to the point where it had much for flavor than the chicken I usually eat. Dessert was a Chocolate Cake with Graham Cracker Ice Cream and Marshmallow. This was a really fun way of making s’mores more sophisticated. The Graham Cracker Ice Cream was a surprising treat, and the toasted marshmallow on the top was freshly made and completed the s’mores theme. A few weeks later I returned to Range for brunch with over a dozen of my girl friends. There is a great back room, with its own fireplace that is perfect for events. I ordered the Ham Benedict, because I am obsessed with benedicts. The theme of the brunch was organizing and setting goals for the new year, and we were all given to do lists from Thyme Is Honey which help you set goals for the day, menu plan, and make sure you drink enough water. Range’s brunch has a nice mix of breakfast dishes and heartier (man friendly) lunch fare, making it a fun place for a group brunch with friends, or a quiet brunch with your significant other. Range is located at 1119 West Webster Street in Lincoln Park. They do take reservations and they are very accommodating to large groups. If you mention The Kittchen at Range in January or February you will get 10% off your bill.",Kit Graham,27459907,23429904,DINING

Macku Sushi,https://www.zomato.com/chicago/macku-sushi-lincoln-park/reviews,"Jan 26, 2018",1,"“ Terrible service can overpower any food, no matter how carefully prepared and delicious it may be. We will definitely not be back and we do not recommend this place at all”   I get the feeling that your experience at Macku (with our first server at least Tall, big build, Asian) can depend MASSIVELY on who you are and possibly even on how you look. My boyfriend and I went to celebrate our 7th anniversary last Saturday. We both work and go to school full time so date nights are rare and we had been looking forward to this all month. We had a reservation so we were sat quickly and noticed a few empty tables so we were looking forward to it being a smooth dinner. Our initial server, whose name I wish I would have caught must of thought we were deaf - He came to our table and loudly asked “What do you want to drink?” - No introduction, no chef specials, just those 6 words.  We totally disregarded it, we were there to celebrate you know? I simply said “no not yet, we’d like to take a look at the menu first, thank you.” He grunted as he walked away and came back within a few minutes and loudly asked again “WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DRINK”, I told him we were ready to order some appetizers if he didn’t mind. Which of course he did, and he made sure to make it known, he said he wasn’t ready for an order and that he would be right back and walked away. He then left to take care of the table right next to us, in a gentle and very informative manner he explained the menu and took their order without any hesitation!!!   Before becoming a nurse I’ve waited tables at many restaurants, because of that, I am always apt to cut servers a lot of slack but this guy was so rude and his treatment was simply inexcusable. I honestly don’t even know how or why we made it this far at this point. Anyhow as we were trying to order off the menu he would simply say NO, NO, NO WE DON’T HAVE THAT - Instead of suggesting what they did actually have because at this point it seemed as if they had nothing. We were able to order a few appetizers, sashimi, and our drinks. We received our food rather quickly, my boyfriend (FYI: HE IS A SUSHI CHEF downtown) asked for Wasabi and the server SCOLDED him and said he would ruin the sashimi with more wasabi  and refused to bring it to the table. We asked a different server for the wasabi, and with no hesitation it was brought to us. Again, why are we still here? This is beyond ridiculous, it can’t possibly get any worse, can it?  Ohhhh but it certainly can. After repeatedly seeing that same server kindly explain the menu to other tables, he came to our table and said “The chef’s have a big order coming so you have to order your entire meal right now if not you’re going to have to wait more than an hour for food so what do you want” 1. We were the ONLY table he said that too. 2. There were a few empty tables still and 3. We still hadn’t received the drinks we ordered more than 15 minutes prior and yet he was trying to kick us out?!   After botching every possible aspect of our meal, I voiced my opinion to the manager. She sincerely apologized and offered us a Do Over with a different server. Nickolas was our second server and the experience difference was insane, he was fantastic and explained everything to us which we are grateful for - However, Terrible service can overpower any food, no matter how carefully prepared and delicious it may be. We will definitely not be back and we do not recommend this place at all.",Estefania Salgado,50312001,33297130,DINING
