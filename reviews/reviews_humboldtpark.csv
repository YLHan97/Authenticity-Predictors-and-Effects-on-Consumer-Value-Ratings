Jimmy's Red Hots,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g35805-d4195572-Reviews-Jimmy_s_Red_Hots-Chicago_Illinois.html,13-Oct-19,5,Jimmy’s is a perfect Chicago dog experience,"This long time Chicago dog spot is perfect in all regards. There is plenty of parking behind the building. The two counters each welcome a separate line of customers. The dogs come wrapped with a generous helping of fries. The fries are of good diameter and are cooked to tasty crispness. Agree to the extra salt on your fries. If it kills you, you will die with a smile on your face. The steamed Vienna dog was dressed with chopped onion and two terrific sized sport peppers. Of course, you will want to stand at the counter to chow down."

Just up the block from my old house, there's no other place to get your red hot from when in Chicago. They are the epitome of the Chicago dog. I'm in Chicago 25 minutes and Grand Avenue exit is it; before anything else! There isn't anything better than a Jimmy's Red Hot with some glow in the dark relish! So, what's Chicago style? Just don't------don't----ask for Ketchup."

I used to go there in the 60s when I went to grade school nearby. Went there yesterday and it was good as always. Highly recommend. I like my polish boiled rather than portillo's grilled and that's what I had.

I was a little nervous driving thru a couple of the areas we went thru to find it, and when I saw Jimmy's I'll admit, I was a little skeptical. Decided to give it a shot, and NEVER LOOKED BACK! It was really, REALLY good! And - felt like such a non-touristy experience! Took me a minute to decide what I wanted, then went with a Polish sausage and fries. Crazy good! Of course there was NO KETCHUP - and that was okay! Had mine with mustard and relish and was wowed! Staff behind the counter were extremely friendly to these visitors from Kansas! Ample free parking, quick service, good food. Win, win in my book!"

Huge order of fries with the dogs and super prices. Definitely a traditional stop for us now .. I just have to remember to bring my own ketchup .. I know they say no ketchup on dogs but come on .. ya gotta have ketchup for the fries!!! Not a bad part of town .. at least when we were there .. mid afternoon.

We had to stop here on our road trip and try their Vienna red hot with fries. Definitely one of a kind. Also splurged ($1.24 ;-) !!) and had some SUPREME TAMALES (Yellow cornmeal shell encases tender ground beef flavored with garlic and seven secret spices.) Very tasty. For these ridiculously low prices, you can't go wrong for a quick lunch or snack."

The hot dogs are just good now. Instead of sport peppers, a large dark green strong dominating pepper accompanies the thin wiener.  The fries are now thick and drier; not thin long and greasy."

Now that I live(way) across town, I use any excuse to get back to Jimmy's. I've eaten there 3-times this summer, 5-times this year. I guess it takes me back to when I was carefree youngster, trekking up and down Pulaski rd.Enough nostalgia. I still can't put my finger on what makes me crave those Dogs. They're Hot Dogs(cooked) in a tub of water. But MAN! are they good.I don't stray away from(MY Favorite) the Dogs. I get my dog w/Relish & Onions, and ask for my fires to be crispy and no salt.There's No place to sit(no dining area) so your vehicle becomes a make-shift Eatery.*Hint* you might wanna bring something to put your food on/in when you get to your car(the fries come extremely hot).I'm talking a paper bag, a plastic bag, paper box. Something to separate you(and your clothing) from the Dog and fries wrapper.1-oppsie and you got condiments, Fries- Hot Dogs-everywhere.Jimmy's is a neighborhood place. Nothing fancy. It's like a-""Mecca"" as folks flock to the place. Sit there(people watch), & eat your Dog, and you'll SEE what I'm talking about.Just thinking about this place, is making me hungry.Gotta think of an excuse to Get back to Jimmy's."

Hot dogs are wonderful and given all the different places you can get a hot dog in the city, this is one of the better ones. And if you aren't a fan of hot dogs, they have you covered with tamales! Can't go wrong here-order a bit of everything, and make sure you have cash on hand as this is a ""cash only"" joint."

I swear it's the same staff that's been there as long as I can remember and the place is like a time capsule from the 1980's. The only thing that's changed is the pricing which is still an amazing value. Fries are wrapped in with the dogs and you can feed 4 here for about $20. 2 key things to remember, cash only and ketchup is non existent and don't be an idiot and ask for it. "

This is about one of the most basic hot dog stands that you will find."
Jimmy's Red Hots,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g35805-d4195572-Reviews-Jimmy_s_Red_Hots-Chicago_Illinois.html,22-May-16,5,"Nobody, repeat nobody, puts ketchup on a hot dog","There are thousands of hot dog stands in the Chicago area but I have to believe that Jimmy's Red Hots at 4000 West Grand Avenue, at Grand and Pulaski, is the epitome of what an old-fashioned, greasy-spoon hot dog stand is supposed to be. Established in 1954, it is a family-owned business that doesn't win any awards for decor. In fact, the best seat is probably your own car. It is a no-nonsense, no-ketchup, no-tables, get-in-and-get-out business with a short menu that is easy to memorize. What'll you have? All-beef Vienna hot dog with all the trimmings or a Vienna beef Polish sausage with fries? There are a few other options...double dog, tamales, combo (red hot and Polish sausage), double Polish or veggie dog with fries. Everything is wrapped in paper and tossed in a bag. It isn't pretty but its juicy and beefy. Remember, Jimmy's abides by the Golden Rule stated on a sign than hangs beneath the menu board (Never, ever, don't even think about it) and reiterated by Clint Eastwood in his Dirty Harry movie: ""Nobody, I mean nobody, puts ketchup on a hot dog."" At Jimmy's, a customer would rather order a glass of milk."

The buns don't have seeds but the dogs have ""snap"". You can get a lot of dog toppings but NO CATSUP! If you ask you will be embarrassed - check out the t-shirts. This has to be the best food deal in Chicago $3.00 for a dog AND excellent fries - unheard of! Don't be off put by the location or the clientele . Usually busy but the line moves fast. Free parking is a bonus. "

It's never been fancy, there's a queue that moves rather quickly and behind it there's a counter for people to consume. This time it was dirtier than usual outside (maybe the trash wasn't collected that day) but it's never been the cleanliest of places either. I was served my polish sausage and fries and when I unwrapped them, there was someone's body hair on my food. No one wears nets so with beards, head and body hair everywhere it was bound to happen.Jimmy's used to be a great place, but it's come down quite a bit."

It's a holdover from the old maxwell street days on union street alongside the 290 extension and behind the UIC Forum. But it is THE PLACE TO GO FOR DOGS, FRIES, AND POLISH SAUSAGE. I can never eat just one hot dog and I don't have a big appetite, but as you get down to the last bite i nearly want to cry BECAUSE IT'S ALMOST GONE. The only condiment is mustard, so don't even ask for catsup on your dog because they won't do it....the fries are greasy and skinny, but they are soooooo dellish and a perfect accompaniment to the dog, that they take on a life of their own. An institution, if you are visiting Chicago, find this place, skip Portillos, and you have something to talk about to your friends at home."

The guys behind the counter weren't overly friendly but i guess they served us up a hot hotdog pretty quickly and shipped us out. The food was tasty and it served it's purpose well in filling us up! I can imagine that it'd be a great spot to swing past to grab a snack if we lived there. Note: There's no seating here. It's like a walk through. You order your dog and move on out!

Very good hot dogs and Polish sausages (Vienna Beef) along with handcut fries. The only drawback was no ketchup. I understand Chicago dogs traditionally do not have ketchup on them, but at least have it for the fries. It's been here over 60 years and is open late. Try it. "

Jimmy's Red Hots,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g35805-d4195572-Reviews-Jimmy_s_Red_Hots-Chicago_Illinois.html,13-Feb-15,5,"Red hots, Polish, fries--and tamales?","Jimmy's Red Hots has been doing business at the intersection of West Grand and Pulaski on Chicago's West Side for more than 55 years. Hey, they've been on that corner since before Pulaski was called Crawford. During that time, Jimmy's credo has been: No ketchup. The phrase was made famous by Clint Eastwood in the 1983 movie ""Sudden Impact,"" when Eastwood's signature character Harry Callahan told a fellow cop who was chomping on a ketchup-filled hot dog: ""Nobody, I mean nobody, puts ketchup on a hot dog!"" At Jimmy's, the condiments don't include ketchup. Jimmy's is sparse in a lot of ways...one tiny room with people lined up to one side waiting to order and a long counter facing the windows on the other side, no tables outside and a very small menu of red hots, Polish sausage, soft drinks, fries and tamales. Call if an ""on the go"" cuisine. It is a no-nonsense, standing-room-only, get-in-and-get-out operation. The best seat probably is your own car. But it's a good bet that you probably haven't tasted better hot dogs or Polish sausage or tamales or fries anywhere else. Jimmy's uses all-beef natural casing dogs from Vienna Beef and the fries are freshly cut and fried twice. Two hot dogs with mustard and relish, French fries and a 32-ounce drink costs about $8. There are a lot of hot dog joints in Chicago--and every one of them has a cadre of devoted followers--but Jimmy's Red Hots has survived the test of time. This is an original."

Insinuating they took the missing meat and items !!!! Since I insisted something needed to be done the woman on the phone said she could not do anything at the moment so to wait for her call once she looked into it NEXT DAY! and that she was certain it was not their mistake. Called me next day just to waste my time saying that I'd have to deal with the delivery company because they do not assume responsibility for items going wrong if they are delivered by a third party.

I was tempted to order a second one. I was only passing through, so I didn't get a chance to try anything else on the menu.  The restaurant atmosphere is also nice too. There are clearly some older pictures of the place online, and it looked totally different when I visited (I almost missed it walking by).  I'm hoping to bring family back here for dinner.

We had a chips and salsa appetizer and then the cemita jamon...and chalupa carne asada.  First the chips and salsa.  Salsa is Pico de gallo salsa which is fine, however, there seemed to be no heat to the salsa.  I did see some peppers among the tomatoes and onions, but did not seem to have that hot that you get.   I understand that it is not to be on fire, but should have had some heat.  The cemita may have been my doing as i wanted something different than the typical milanesa and went to try the jamon.  I probably should have stayed with the milanesa.   there was nothing special or tasty about the jamon.  Its seems that there was some flavor missing as if there was no spice, or sauce to give it some flavor.  The bread was basically a roll that was spread with a good portion of avacado.  Overall, just a plain ham on roll with some avacado.  I was looking to experience the same as what i had in Puebla MX. As for the chalupa, it was basically 5 tacos stacked on a plate and by the time we got to the bottom ones, the taco was falling apart as we lifted it due to the juice and moisture from the ones on top.   we thought we would try this on a recommendation, however, I may give the milanesa a try, but truthfully, it did not give me that ""lets stop in again someday"" feeling. Sorry guys...just ended up being an ok place.More"

I had sautéed spinach as a side; this was very good, so no complaints there.  I also had a side salad, which really did not perform --  lettuce and tomatoes and a vinegrette that was too vinegar-y with no spices  I had to salt the heck out of this just to eat it. Could they have thrown in some cucumbers or eggs or shredded cheese?  Anything else would have helped it.  Just lettuce and tomatoes do not make for an appealing salad.  Maybe I came on an off day? I don't know.  But I will not be rushing back there anytime soon.  With Taco el Jalicience right on the corner, if I am going out in this neighborhood, I will go there.  Sorry, Feed.

If you're from out-of-town, the location is a straight shot west of MagMile.  The Chicago bus lets off right out front.  It's in an industrial area and there's not much besides a bar or two...besides Feed.  Don't let this discourage you from going over there; it's worth the trip if you love hearty comfort food.   Right off the bat the staff was super friendly and helpful with suggestions from the menu of what was good that night.  We split a whole chicken with 3 sides and dessert for around $20.  The chicken was cooked very well but not dry, skin fantastic.  The mac n cheese was nice and creamy and light but not too cheesy.  I personally liked it that way, although others may be looking for a heavier/cheesier dish.  The homemade mashed potatoes were perfect.  The potato salad was heavy on the mustard and my friend loved it but I stuck with the black beans.  Ask to try stuff before ordering if you're not sure.  I'm pretty sure if their not really busy they'll help you pick something to your liking.    I wanted to try the corn pudding everyone raves about but the counter guy said not to as it was a bit dry late in the day.  I appreciate the honesty as he clearly wanted us to have a great first impression.  Friendly service is just as important as the food to me these days.   Finally, dessert was the triple berry pie.  I was very impressed with my slice. It was slightly heated with whipped cream and still retained a nice texture.  Usually heated berry pies get all runny and soupy on the plate.  Not too much blueberry, not too much blackberry made it very good.  At this point, I was ready for a food nap and we still each had over a half plate to wrap up for home.  Now I know it's not about the quantity but the quality, but when you're on a dining budget, it's nice to have a leftover lunch of tasty treats the next day.    This food is really really good, fair pricing and a casual comfortable setting to eat it in.  Thank you Feed, we'll be back to try that corn pudding soon.More"

We entered La Palma to discover the traditional buffet-style service sitting behind...the display case. Being Puerto Ricans from New York who currently live in Detroit, we have travelled extensively and eaten Puerto Rican food at many places. Never have I been charged $16 for “mixing” offerings from the buffet. The plate we received was also the traditional 50-75% rice, so it wasn’t as if we received the “extra meat” on our plate we were charged for. Despite raising the issue with the cashier and making an accounting that recognized the amount we were being charged, she assured us that her numbers were correct. I didn’t want to make my husband uncomfortable and spoil our meal by insisting that we had been overcharged. I wish I had... I wish we had left.  We also ordered the jibarito, which paled in comparison to the glowing reviews here. Like the rest of the meal, the flavors were not bland but were unremarkable. The place caters to a diverse palate, which translates into erring on the side of reducing the “garlicky” flavor that characterizes Puerto Rican food. I found the jibarito tasteless, but took half of my unconsumed meal home for the dog…even he didn’t want it.  We were further disappointed to learn that the order for the jibarito wasn’t communicated the chef, even though I had placed it over three times with the overstaffed locale that had servers, cooks and cashiers tripping over themselves. The mix-up was resolved as I waited and as my husband finished his meal, which made for a long meal with one or the other of us waiting as the other ate. My toddler didn’t much appreciate the extensive wait either.  In sum, we paid $26 for inadequate service, one plate of food, one jibarito, and one bottled soft drink. This price is comparable to a much more upscale restaurant, which was not appropriate for the relatively bland favors, unremarkable location, and backyard-style décor we found here. Neither of us would return. We would never recommend La Palma to anyone we like.More"

From the moment we stepped inside to show proof of vaccination, Armand was cracking jokes, being kind, and going out of his way to accommodate us. We had no reservation as we did not know how popular and lovely this place was, but we made space for us quickly. The service was impeccable, Armand treated us like family, our server was quick and charming, and the food…. To die for. I had the fettuccini special and my fiancé had a pasta with vodka sauce. We also had the broccoli salad. The food was absolutely amazing and slam packed with flavor. We will be recommending this restaurant to everyone we know! 10/10. Also, I’m writing this review from our Lyft back to the hotel because it was THAT good!"

No words can describe how great of an experience we had. My husband and I came to Chicago on holiday from New Jersey. We found this restaurant online and called and made a same day reservation. Upon entering the restaurant the place was packed by locals. Armando one of the owners immediately greeted us. He welcomed us and sat us immediately. This place must of been at 95% capacity. We felt at home. Our waitress Anya was also great. Armando kept coming to check on us. Such an amazing staff. Best Italian food I ever had. The portions were huge. Armando also shared a couple of tequilas with us. I’ve traveled around the world and we never felt more welcomed at a food establishment. I can’t rave enough about this place.

The best dish for me was Spaghetti Loquercio (Al Dente Pasta) With onions, fresh tomatoes, bacon and basil, little spicy tossed with lite Romano cheese topped with crumble sausage. I would definitely order that as it is unique and delicious. My wife had spaghetti marinara that she enjoyed. The grilled calamari was not as good as I had anticipated. Think the fried would have been better? One lady in my party of 3 had the pasta nero.....wished she had ordered what I had.

La Scarola is an authentic Italian restauant, on par with meals we’ve had throughout Italy. The atmosphere was warm & cozy, the service was excellent and you really feel like the staff is delighted you’re there. Armando (the owner) personally greets and checks-in on his diners’ meals.

The food is excellently made with authentic flavors and ingredients - no over-sugared marinara sauce here. Also no lack of butter and cream, so watch out!That is worth noting - the portion sizes are Rosebud-esque and so share with a friend or expect to bring half home. If you want an appetizer or wish to enjoy the excellent bread (served with great olive oil and parmesan for dipping), then that entree might be require a change to the belt loop. The eggplant parmesan was enormous, with cheese and sauce spilling over the edge of the plate. The sublime gnocchi (this version with sausage, asparagus and tomato in a a light butter sauce), was a mound of delight (see nearby picture).The decor is a throwback too - Italian- or Chicago-themed celebrity pictures from floor to ceiling, tables piled on top of each other, friendly waiters. Quite a different feel from nearby (also excellent) Piccolo Sogno. NOT Covid-friendly however!!!Highly recommended."

The “mature d” is a wonderful gentleman - warm, friendly, funny. I did not have a reservation but he told me not worry and I was seated in less than 10 minutes. I was dining solo and the restaurant was full, so I greatly appreciate him working me in. The staff is friendly - the atmosphere is welcoming - like you have been invited into their home in Italy and are part of the family immediately. It was a Friday night, so there were couples on dates, families, mom’s with children, girls night diners, all adding to a lively evening. The FOOD - so GOOD!! My only regret is I don’t know enough about cuisine to describe it properly. The house salad with house dressing is AMAZING! Fresh with light leafy lettuce and a tasty balsamic dressing. I had a pasta special with sausage, peas, sun dried tomatoes, cheese filled pasta, and a Gorgonzola cream sauce. Wow! It was wonderful. No dessert but on another evening walk, I’ll drop in for dessert and coffee (and maybe a to-go dinner : ) They are doing to-go and outside dining.

Frank Sinatra and Sophia Loren dined there. But my wife and I hesitated to get dinner reservations because we heard that the venue was so small and noisy and there was no parking available. Well, forget the negatives. There are so many positives. It is as good as advertised, even better. Located at 721 West Grand Avenue, in the River West/West Loop neighborhood, east of the busy Grand/Milwaukee/Halsted intersection, La Scarola is open from 5 to 11 Monday through Friday, from 4 to 11 on Saturday and from 4 to 10 on Sunday. Small and noisy but cozy and cheerful, the dining room features autographed photographs of celebrities on the walls, including an Honorary Frank Sinatra Way street sign overhanging the room, and Chicago Cubs banners. But the food, served on white tablecloth, is exceptional. You know you're dining in a special place when so many dishes are described as ""best in town."" Like cannoli and pasta & fagioli soup and veal. My wife and I started with minestrone, pasta & fagioli with Cannellini beans, pasta and cheese finished with basil and wine, shrimp Armani with shrimp grilled and sauteed in red spicy sauce set over garlic blended with potatoes garnished with argula, and bruschetta with tomatoes, garlic, romano cheese, basil and extra virgin oil served over toasted Italian bread. For entrees, we chose Veal Marsala with Provimi veal and mushrooms flamed with marsala wine and served with a side of pasta and Veal Chop, a 10-ounce veal chop pounded paper thin, breaded and pan fried and finished with garlic, parsley, lemon and extra virgin olive oil and set over dried Italian potatoes. For dessert, we shared large portions of cannoli and tiramisu. Two reminders: valet parking costs only $8. And be sure to purchase a copy of the book, ""The Walls of La Scarola,"" which details the best stories and moments of the restaurant's 20-year history. A visit to La Scarola is a truly special dining experience with a great atmosphere for a bonus."

Most of the waiters have been there forever. It's crowded and noisy. There is so much going on. Lots of little nooks and crannies. Food is mostly classic Italian steakhouse dishes. Always handwritten specials. Excellent, moderately priced Italian wine list. Food is always great."

The food was classic Italian with plenty of menu choices. But the atmosphere is pretty hard to describe. We were there on New Years Eve and there was never a dull moment. Reservations are a must. But, be prepared that they will not be ready for you when you show up. If they send you to the bar next door, Richards, unless you are a cigarette smoker don't go! Step across the street to Clover until your table is ready."

Think the fried would have been better?   One lady in my party of 3 had the pasta nero.....wished she had ordered what I had.   The total bill including appetizers and three entrees was $180 including a glass of wine for each of us.More"
